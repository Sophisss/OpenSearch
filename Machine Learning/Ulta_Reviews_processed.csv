Moroccan Sea Salt Spray;This is my favorite sea salt spray, and I am so happy to see it back in stock. While it does not magically give me perfect beach waves on my damp hair, it helps it to dry less frizzy. Brad Modo does a great video on how to acheive the effortless beach wave look. I use it after I've added soft curls with my straightner to give the waves an extra boost.
Moroccan Sea Salt Spray;I spay it on after washing my hair & let it work it's magic to air dry.  If I feel like curly get later in the day I do that also a bit in the hold stays for a few days
Moroccan Sea Salt Spray;I don't like this spray at all. It makes my hair look dirty and oily. Not what I was hoping for. It was a waste of money.
Moroccan Sea Salt Spray;Good
Moroccan Sea Salt Spray;When I don't use product I have pretty wavy/curly hair so I thought but using this product it would enhance it! It ended up deflating my hair and ended up making it somehow like pin straight. The smell is alright but I do not think I'd buy again! I'm still going to give it some more tries as it could just be the way I'm applying it.
Moroccan Sea Salt Spray;I love this spray. I use this all the time in the summer.  I will dry my hair with a diffuser then spray this in and scrunch.  I will also use this on 2nd day hair to bring curls to life. This give me the exact beachy curls I get from swimming in the ocean and being on the beach all day.
Moroccan Sea Salt Spray;I use this product on clean hair and next day hair.  With age my hair has become wavy so I spritz it on and use a diffuser.  If needed I add a little more after drying and scrunch it. It give that beach wavy look to it without weighing it down.    I am able to get a second day without washing my hair by spritzing and scrunching the next morning. On day 2 hair does feel a little stiff but has not affected the health of my hair.
Moroccan Sea Salt Spray;This is the best sea salt spray out there and I've tried almost all of them!  I use this when my hair is almost dry and it makes my curls really pop.
Moroccan Sea Salt Spray;I have wavy hair, and this is the only sea salt spray that helps my wavy hair look great and relaxed without weighing down my hair or making it greasy looking. I've noticed this hasn't been in stock to reorder, and I hope this hasn't been discontinued!
Moroccan Sea Salt Spray;It definitely adds texture and increases my curls but only when used on wet hair. I do enjoy the smell but it doesn't add the shine it says and I felt drying of my hair
Moroccan Sea Salt Spray;Just spray for a voluminous hair style.
Moroccan Sea Salt Spray;While it's good for volume, it left my hair looking wild after I brushed it out. Will try again and not brush it out
Moroccan Sea Salt Spray;It leaves hair feeling really dry. Yes
Moroccan Sea Salt Spray;This product smells like angels! However, it leaves your hair feeling pretty dry/tangly.
Moroccan Sea Salt Spray;I was so excited about this because I usually like how well Moroccan oil hydrated my hair but this sea salt spray definitely sets my hair and makes it super tangled, I have to add extra oil after application to prevent tangles
Moroccan Sea Salt Spray;I have thick, already slightly wavy hair. This just tangles it. I do like the smell though. I generally love this brand but don't recommend this product.
Moroccan Sea Salt Spray;I have fine hair that can't end to look flat or not stay nice all day. Sea Sakt Spray gives my hair a lift and helps curl stay all day.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I have easily oily hair. I use it on the morning to tame bed head hair. my hair gets oily easy and my scalp aches with too much conditioner or product. This stuff does not weigh me down or cause oil or heaviness. I love it. Bought back up bottles. It detangles. Can't say enough good.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I love and recommend this stuff. I have oily hair. Can't use much conditioner because it weighs my hair down then my scalp hurts.  Same with much product. This stuff is awesome tho. I use this on my hair in the morning to comb out my bed head hair. Have no issues with weighing it down at all. Does not look greasy. Adds a bit of shine. Detangles as well. Highly recommend!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I struggled w frizz hair my whole life, this totally controlled the frizz, I've tried other Ogx hair serum like the coconut oil made my hair frizz sm, this one doesn't, I couldn't imagine my life without it. Gives my hair thickness, non frizz hair
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I was worried because the shampoos by ogx are not the best, and I recently stopped using them. I bought this and used as an after-shower hydration oil. It kept my hair shiny, soft and overall softened my dry ends. I only used a nickel sized amount in my wet hair and it lasted me like 3 or 4 months. I'm buying more again, but I think it depends on your hair type because other oils make my hair very greasy and stiff.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;This product makes your hair look shiny & soft, but after using it for a couple weeks I noticed my damaged hair got extremely dry & brittle. Wouldn't recommend.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I style my hair and apply just a few drops of this oil oil for some shine. It makes my hair feel so soft, shiny and of course it smells amazing. Also Gus product doesn't make your hair feel sticky like some other hair oils. I definitely recommend this product!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;This is a great mosturizer for dry hair. Applies easily with wet hair. Smell is sutle and nice.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;Heads up: this is not an oil! It's a serum. It's not going to moisturize your hair, but it's incredible for making it shiny, smell good, and frizz-less. If you want an oil that will actually moisturize your strands, OGX doesn't have that. Use 100% pure oils (from The Ordinary or SheaMoisture). I use this product along with Jamaican castor oil on my ends and love it. This doesn't make it look oily, so it's great to put on in the morning to help my ends and my little frizz on top of my head, and then comb the excess through my hair so it's smooth and shiny.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I tried this product on my hair for several months, and I feel like it did NOTHING for my hair. It made my hair dry, brittle, frizzy and caused dandruffs. I also couldn't stand the smell. I threw it in the trash where it belongs. If I could give this product zero stars I would. I don't recommend this product.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;i would not recommend ANY of the ogx products except for their shampoo+conditioner. this product contains bad silicones that could potentially make your hair fall out.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;"Gave it two stars because is smells ok but it didn't ""heal"" my hair. I don't get why this has so many good reviews? There are better oils out there"
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I love this spray because other oils are too heavy for fine, thin hair.  Great control, so hair is not too oily.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I have been using this for over a month and my hair looks healthier and feels less dry on my ends. And it's not too pricey for the good product that you get. You don't have to use much either and it smells great!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I've got long, curly hair and this works quite well for detangling or adding some shine to the ends. Smells good too!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I've been growing my hair out and the longer it gets, the dryer it becomes. This oil works wonders! I highly recommend!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;this thing WORKS! i always use this after i wash my hair and when i wake up the next morning my hair is so curly, so smooth, and shiny! but i would not recommend using this as a heat protectant or after you style your hair, just use a spray.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;Great product & affordable..
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I have thick wavy easily oily hair. I can't go very many days without washing but I prefer to. I can't use conditioner much because my scalp starts to hurt the next day when I do. Decided to try this and love it. Doesn't weigh my hair down. I use it after I blow it straight. Calms the frizz and adds a bit of shine.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I've already noticed changes only after a week using this product. My hair is shiner and looks and feels healthier. Get this!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I have been using this product for 3 years
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;This product is awesome. I originally bought it about a year ago to help tame my frizz when I curl my hair. It works pretty good for that. I do find that it weakens the curls though. What I found that this product works amazing for us healing split ends! I put this on the ends of my hair every night and brush through it. I've been doing that for about 2 months and my hair dresser said that she's never seen my hair so healthy!! Try this product it's amazing!!!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;Excellent!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I love this hair product.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;Got this because my hair was super dry after putting some blonde in it and it literally did everything I needed it to do. My hair is SO soft now. And also I would like to add I have very oily hair and most oils make my hair super greasy but this didn't do that. I don't spray it near my roots though.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I use this after styling to give my hair some protection and moisture.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I used this product after blowing out my hair, and then put my hair in a French braid. In the morning when I took the braid out my hair smelled like mildew, I completely dried my hair before I used it so I know it wasn't just from my hair still being wet.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;Love this product! I have very thick&frizzy hair and this helped tame away the frizz and made my hair feel very soft. I use it after I blow dry or straighten my hair. I also sometimes spray it on the ends of my hair when they need some extra moisture. It also smells amazing!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;This is amazing as a leave in conditioner, doesn't make my hair greasy at all. I've used this for years. Get it if you have dry hair or split ends.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I love how this smells!! It makes my hair smell like it just came from the salon. It's a good product if you shower in the morning because it keeps my hair soft all day but by the next day my hair is flat and dry.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I love how it smoothens my skin at the end of the day it really is smooth I love that feeling I just can't stand the smell of this thing, it's smells weird for me and also after atleast 18hrs of wearing it it leaves a heavy amount of grease in my hair that's why I had to immediately shower ew
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I used to use this a few years ago and I remember liking it, but when I tried using it now it was awful. It made my hair both dry and greasy somehow....like lots of frizz but weighed down with a greasy look. Maybe it's better if you blow dry your hair? Had to return.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;definitely made a huge difference to my hair. I use it after I shower and/or straighten my hair. it leaves my hair feeling so silky. a little bit goes a long way
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I sprayed around 7 pumps to only the ENDS of my hair because that is where my hair is most frizzy. Worked WONDERS!! I did use the olapex shampoo and conditioner while in the shower, but this product was really able to cut out the frizz and leave my hair shiny and soft. I've dyed it around three times in the past year, once with bleach, and this product knocked the frizz out.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I put it on my freshly shampooed hair for styling. Leaves my hair sleek and shiny.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;Product is best on market
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I love this stuff! My hair is thin and also damaged from getting highlights. It helps bring moisture back to my hair! The thing that I hate about it though, is I have VERY sensitive acne prone skin and this stuff makes me break out! Still trying to decide if it's worth continuing to use. :-/
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I have been looking for my holy grail leave-in product for my thin hair for so long and I finally found it! It is SO lightweight, doesn't weigh the hair down, and makes it super shiny and soft. My hair has never looked better and since it's oil-based it helps keep out tangles too. This is great for right out of the shower and also for touching up between washes. I always had to wash my hair every 2nd day because my ends were too dry, and this works amazing for helping to treat your ends so you don't have to wash and condition it. All around amazing multi-use product and I'll keep buying it again and again!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;My holy grail. I'll put this on when my hair is damp. After I brush, I'll separate my hair into two. A little goes a long way. It's very moisturizing and doesn't way my hair down. The best part about it is that it brings out my natural waves PERFECTLY. Almost looks like I have heat styled waves. It was always a struggle to bring out my natural waves without product as it would always frizz up. Not this product. Get it! You won't regret it!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I have thick coarse Hispanic hair, this stuff is a god send but you really only need a small amount. It instantly made my frizz vanish without leaving it greasy or sticking together. Super excited I took a risk with this and for the price it really is amazing.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;This oil makes my hair smell good and very soft
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;moisturizes my 3c curls so so well. it feels super duper nice and I love it!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;This is my must have product in my bathroom cabinet. My hair is always so dry no matter what products I use, but this oil has saved me so many times! It adds shine and tames frizz without making my hair oily. I spray on my ends and avoid my scalp. If you have any sort of dry or textured hair, this product is for you!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;this works a little better when my hair is straightened, but it makes my curls lose their definition and feel like straw
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;After reading so many glowing reviews and enjoying another oil by OGX (the biotin one) I decided to give this a try! A few uses in, and I'm disappointed and unimpressed.  The first time I used it, I used about a quarter about, like I would with the biotin oil.  Nope.  My hair ended up so greasy!  For the next few washes, I reduced my amount DRASTICALLY and blow dried my hair, still heavy, sticky, and greasy.  I have medium density hair (not too think, not too fine) so I'm shocked at how much this weighs my hair down.  It also doesn't have any scent, the other oil smelled AMAZING! Did I just get a defective bottle?
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I love the OGX Moroccan oil.  It makes my hair super soft and it smells amazing.  I have naturally fine hair that has some damage from frequent coloring, and a very small amount of this on gently toweled hair after a shower has done amazing things for it.  If you have fine hair I will say it's easy to accidentally use too much, you really need about the size of a pea for shoulder length hair, and if your hair also trends oils at the roots like mine, only apply it to the bottom half of your hair, focusing on the roots.  This also had the side effect of making my hands really soft.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;makes my hair smooth/shiny and really tames frizziness on my hair ! Very lightweight and smells great :)
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I put this on my hair immediately after I shower with other products and I love it.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;i personally love this product. i have very dry and damaged hair and this always leaves it silky and smooth. i put it on after the shower and before i do my hair i also put hair spray in there but this gives it more of a silky finish.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;Moisturizes my hair so well and it makes It so so soft. Very happy with this.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;Both my daughter and I have really frizzy, curly hair. This works great to manage our curls and helps to detangle it as well.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;this oil has been moisturizing and adding shine to my hair all day! I use it after blow drying and apply all over my hair, I love the smell and the frizz control I cant get over it. ogx infused with argan oil of morocco leaving my hair shiny and glowing, no more frizz ! healing dry oil. beeauty pure and simple. Must try.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I love this stuff so much. I think I've bought it like 4 times now! It smells fantastic, it makes my hair so soft and it is way easier to comb through when its wet, and also once it dries. I have pretty fine (and very damaged...whoops) hair that isn't very thick, and it doesn't weigh it down at all. I use about a dime size and rub it on my hands and work in, starting at the bottom. It's great, I can't say that enough.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;Love this product
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;So I never used to use oil because it normally wears my curls down. But this oil! I spray it multiple times day. Makes it shiny & keeps my scalp from being dry. love love love.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;Makes hair more manageable
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;My hair looks/feels soft and healthy.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I usually use this product after I shower it works great on my hair
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;Its great everytime i use it
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;Thank you!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I love this oil! It makes my hair so shiny and soft without being greasy or oily.  I just dyed my hair and everyone complimented how shiny it was.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I was amazed on how amazing my hair turned out! I absolutely loved! i added it to my hair before blow drying and after! my ends would always come out dry but this made it silky smooth!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;It did help with my bleaching my hair and I am sooo happy with it.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;Makes your hair soft and glossy.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;After I work out and shower.  I use it on my hair and it works perfectly.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I was worried this would be too heavy for my thin short hair but it wasn't :) I obviously use a very small portion but this stuff is awesome! Cuts down drying time and leaves my hair super soft and shiney :) I love this way more than the CHi oil.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I am growing out some old color, so the bottom third of my shoulder length hair is pretty parched. I've used the OGX Coconut Oil mist after I'm finished styling with pretty good results.  I decided to try this for a change, and I am so glad I did!  After reading some of the reviews here, I decided to try spraying this on my hair when it's wet to see how it would do.  I cannot believe how smooth it made my hair when I blew it dry!  I don't straighten my naturally wavy hair every day, but my hair just glided through my iron this morning.  I was so impressed, I felt compelled to write a review.  I still sprayed a bit in my hands and ran them through my hair when I was finished styling, like I did with the coconut oil, and it left my hair feeling silky and healthy all day.  I absolutely love this stuff!  Highly recommend.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I have really dry hair and this helped a lot with that, my hair looks less dull, it looks more healthy and it smells amazing!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;Spray into hand and run threw hair or spray a few times a few inches away from ended. Personally helped me with moisture after showers for a fix for my split ends.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;Love this. Smells sooooo good and leaves my hair feeling so soft when I wake up. I put this on after I've showered and brushed my hair.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;It smells amazing! The mist is so fine, it's light weight, not greasy and it gives beautiful shine. I love this!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I spray this on my hair every night before bed and then before I leave for work.  It has completely changed how my hair feels and looks.  I have pain-in-the-butt curly hair thats been through just about every treatment imaginable and dyed (because blondes have more fun right?).  This product has completely changed my life.  I do go through it extremely fast, but its relatively cheap so I don't care!!!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I like the product it smells good and is very light on my hair.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I've been using this for years now. Love it. Seems a little oily when you first put it on, but my hair absorbs it and it gives me softness and shine. I also like the smell.Works great., better than higher priced products.I'm always afraid they will discontinue it.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I asked a question on here about it being shiny enough. I bought it and whoa was it shiny! Love it! I use it almost everyday cause my hair is so thick. The only problem is it's only shiny in the sunshine and never indoors. Thinking about getting the shampoo and conditioner. Maybe that will help.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;Spritz on when using heat and it leaves hair smooth soft and shiny! What a bargain too! Smells great!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;Argan oil really does help maintain my hair. My hair is overprocessed therefore there's only so much it can do which is calm down frizz and coat my hair to keep it from looking like a broom. But I notice my hair turns yellow much quicker and after reading the ingredients listed in the bottle(which are not listed in this website) that it contains red and yellow dyes..
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I have natural curly hair. I don't wash my hair everyday but I wet it everyday. I've been having trouble finding something that can define my curls while keeping them baby soft. This product does that for me.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;It doesn't weight my hair down and pleasant smell.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I seen this once on Pinterest for dry brittle hair. So I purchased once & OMG now this like my 4 bottle or so. I use this once I step out the shower then blow dry or air dry May hair. Smells super good!! I spray once I straighten my hair too. I also use it the next day once I brush my hair. Hubby loves the smell too
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;Just spray it in your hair regularly and you should feel your hair feel softer and livelier. I just spray it on my ends.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;Affordable and actually softens texture of colored hair!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I always put it on my wet hair then blow dry. Just in case I put too much on the blow drying helps dry it out a little more. I also put it on my dry hair to try to smooth out the frizziness. You do need to be careful because you can put to much on and look like you have dirty oily hair.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;this products sucks. messed up my hair, drying it terribly. WORST product ever
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I have dry hair because I dye it.  I use this almost nightly.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;like it very much
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;Tamed frizz and smells amazing 🙌 doesn't leave a greasy residue
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;i use this product every day and it does a great job keeping my hair from getting frizzy. it works much better than other moroccan/argan oil products that i have used in the past. my only issue with it is that it's difficult to dispense the product without getting too much or dripping it all over the side of the bottle
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;Works great
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;Makes my hair feel good and healthy. I use it on damp hair and I love it. Good price too.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;Awesome! Lightweight oil! Superior!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;This is a very lightweight oil and it smells nice.  Not a heavy scent.  I spray a small amount in the palm of my hand and apply it to the ends of my hair.  Does a very nice job.  I ran out of my Moroccan Miricle Oil and was looking for something to use and this works great.  Would definetely recommend.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I love how weightless this product really is. I have thick wavy hair and any product can weigh it down even more. This adds shine, helps with the dryness, smells great, and gives shine without it looking greasy.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I've been spending tons of money on products for my daughter's curly, tangly, sometimes matted, frizzy, dry hair. It's been a nightmare, nothing works well at all. My friend and I were at Ulta and she recommended this. So, it wasn't a wash day for my daughter so I divided her hair into 3 sections, misted with water and sprayed this and then using a WIDE comb, I combed it through. WOW, incredible results. She then went to bed and I expcted to have to fight it again this morning but low and behold it was hardly tangled at all, just a bit at the ends. Another misting of water and this and it was perfect again.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;Makes my hair soft and smells really good!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;Man I was excited to try this only to find out it has drying ingredients such an trimthone an dimethicone smh
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I have wavy/curly hair and it took me years to find the right product for this humid Florida weather. Glad I chose to buy this product on a whim. It's not greasy on my hair and it smells good too! I usually spray it on my towel-dried hair after shower and my hair is ready in the morning.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I have crazy curly dry hair and this argan oil helps a lot.     I use it daily.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I bought this purely to add moisture to my hair on occasion. Not knowing if it would make my hair greasy, I decided to use it after my hair was towel dried and discovered that it made my hair dry so quickly! It's better than my Redken Pillow Proof Primer Spray and the Redken Diamond Oil Spray for a cheaper price. I can spray quite a bit onto my hair and it won't look greasy, so this product is a win.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I put it in my hair after almost every shower, my hair gets really tangly so this helps smooth it out and makes it feel a lot softer and smoother!!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;One of my all time favorite hair products!!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I use this on my hair twice a week
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I love using this product every day.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;leaves hair shiny and healthy looking! weightless. not greasy.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I love it. For my curls. They shine and stay moisturized throughout the day. Not looking dry
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I used to always think that hair products needed an expensive price tag in order to actually be good, but that's definitely not the case with this product. I have thick, frizzy, and chemically processed hair, and I use this oil every time I wash my hair. I apply it when my hair is still wet and whether I decided to let my hair air dry or I blow dry it, this oil has done so much to keep my hair looking and feeling good!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;"I was having a problem with ""static electricity"" and could not get it controlled.  this product did the trick.  Love it.  My husband also uses it every morning, he is balding and his ""scalp""is dry.  This product works!"
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I am disappointed in this product. I thought it would be a lot more effective and helpful to my damaged and dry hair. It isn't really doing much for me except leaving my hair looking and feeling greasy. The smell is great but i would not recommend this product for trying to restore your hair and get it healthy again. I just don't see it working.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I love this hair oil! I use it on wet hair before I blow dry it and it works better than Living Proof. I also spray a little on my finished hairstyle and it makes my hair soft and smooth. It repaired the damage I had from using Big Sexy Flat Iron Spray. This is amazing and I will continue to buy it again and again!!!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;i use this oil 1-2x a week, it helps keep my hair soft & smooth. i particularly like to use this after using a clarifying shampoo
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;Made my hair shiny but not oily, tamed frizz, smoothed dead ends and smells great! Buying again as I'm almost out of my bottle :)
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;This is hands down the best product I've used on my hair in a very long time.  It makes your hair feel so soft, look soft and not frizzy at all.  I flat iron my hair every day and it makes it look awesome!!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I just wash and go, this oil made my hair less frizzy
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;the best!!!!!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;Are use it after I wash my hair while it's still wet
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;Perfect if you have coarse horse hair like mine. It softens and makes hair more manageable
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;I have a pixie cut I used to bleach platinum myself (my hair is actually in really good condition), but the very back is ruined from the bleaching without help. Currently growing out my pixie for the second time and this helps make me frizzy straw like ends lay flat and feel smooth. Been using for three months now, def recommend. Only wish it fixed my hair rather than covered it.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Penetrating Oil;Essential to smooth and detangle damaged frizzy blonde hair. I use about a tablespoonful on wet hair before I brush and blowdry.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I have been using this product for a few months & have lost so much hair since I have been using. I did not think it was related to the product until I did some research.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I've been using this product for several months, and it left my hair in worse condition than before.  It's way too soft -- and fly-away!  None of which is an improvement over no conditioner at all.  The only good thing I experienced with this product is the fragrance -- if it was a product that did even the minimum of what any conditioner should do, I would buy it just for the fragrance.  Too bad, because I love other OGX products.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;It'll make your hair feel full and give volume, but at the same time it'll weigh it down. Your hair will become oily, and be due for a wash compared to normal time.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I bought this shampoo hoping I could achieve more thick and voluminous hair. However, after using this product only 2 times it left a waxy/sticky coat over my hair and actually made me loose hair. I have never used a product that made me loose so much hair especially if it claims to strengthen your hair
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;As a conditioner
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;i am so disappointed that a product I have used forever has changed. I noticed no difference in shampoo. But this new formula for the conditioner is just sad. totally dries out hair as if theres no conditioner in it at all. My first clue was it was not squeezing out of the bottle right. It actually tangles my hair leaving it hard now and not soft and easy to get a wide tooth comb through this thin hair. I am so disappointed and am going to have to change brands. I pulled out a sample bottle and then this. The ingredient's are switched around and some changed. I am going to have to throw away a bottle 3/4 full. I used so much last night to try to make it work and its still horrid.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Not sure if this is a bad bottle, but I have a heck of a time getting product out of container, and when I do, its just a blob and it doesn't lather up.  Not to impressed at this point.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I was surprised I liked this shampoo and conditioner so much. I think the people who didn't like it probably were using it every time they washed their hair. I alternate with a higher quality shampoo and conditioner (lanza and a purple shampoo) and I've never had a problem with build up. Im obsessed with the smell! I can go to bed with my hair wet and just brush it in the morning and it looks like I just had a blow out.  Is this the best shampoo and conditioner for the health of your hair? Probably not.. but its a good one to have in the shower for the days you want something different.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Smells absolutely awful, would NOT recommend!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;"This is the strangest shampoo (and the conditioner) to me. I am used to shampoos that feel frothy and rich, and conditioners that feel silky when I rinse them out. I do a lot of detangling with my fingers in the shower because my hair is so long. It's well past my waist, almost to the top of my legs. Finger detangling in the shower helps prevent a lot of breakage. This shampoo (and the conditioner) scared me at first. I could hardly get my fingers through my hair. It knotted up when I shampooed, and took forever to get the knots out. The shampoo seemed to completely strip my hair, or so it felt. I'm talking SQUEEEEEAKY clean. I assumed that when it dried, it would look like a broom. But it didn't. I also used the conditioner, which didn't give me a warm fuzzy feeling, either. I didn't use any detangler or hair oil out of the shower because I wanted to see exactly how this stuff worked for me. I carefully detangled with a flat detangling brush and let it air dry. And it looked amazing! I was shocked. My hair was so shiny and soft. It had lots of movement, and my waves had definition. I've used about half of both bottles so far, and I'm not seeing any change. My hair doesn't seem to be drying out or breaking, and I haven't noticed any unusual hair fall. I'm still on the fence, though, because it's so difficult to detangle. The ""after"" is great for me. It's getting there that's difficult, and I don't like spending ages on my hair. I want to wash, detangle, and let it air dry on its own."
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Great product!! Loved it! Give a heavy hair look. happy with purchase.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I recently cut my waist-length hair off to about my jawline, and was seriously concerned about volume. My hair has always been super thin, so when I chopped it off, I was instantly on the hunt for a good voluming shampoo. I work at Ulta and despite my employee discount, I'm not a fan of dropping a ton of money on shampoos because I like to mix mine to get various benefits. OGX has worked great for me in the past and I love that it's cruelty free and very affordable. While this shampoo in particular doesn't smell the ~best~ it works AMAZING. My hair has gotten some SERIOUS volume since I've started using it and I've found myself using less volumizing styling products just because I don't want my hair to look poofy! Can't say I've had to deal with that before! Overall, I totally recommend and will plan on getting this again once I run out!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;So far I love it
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This made my hair feel dry and as if there was a coat of sticky wax covering it - will not be buying again
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I have used several different kinds of shampoo and this one made my thin post postpartum hair thick and healthy
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;After trying this product for two months, I'm going tomorrow to get my long hair cut off at my neck because it feels like straw, is breaking, and falling out.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I read the other reviews about the DMDM in this that causes hair loss. After using this shampoo my hair falls out, is dry and brittle. Looking at the ingredients on Ulta's website, the DMDM is not listed. On the bottle in my shower it's listed plain as day!! Why didn't ulta include it on their ingredients?! That's shady.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This shampoo knotted my hair up so bad, and I experienced so much hair loss. Honestly while I was using it I never thought anything of it until i seen that other people were experiencing the same issue, it also dried out my hair. Never will purchase this again!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;The best product ever if you have damaged hair
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I've been using this for about 2 years, thinking it was good for my hair. WRONG! It has DMDM Hydantoin as well as other ingredients that DAMAGE your hair and cause HAIR LOSS! As a 27-yr old experiencing hair loss, this is not okay!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I decided to try this after reading an article rating shampoos for thin hair, (this was the reasonably priced option) and boy I'm sure glad I did! My very fine, very thin hair seems thicker and fuller after only about a week of daily washing! It also does not seem to be drying like other shampoos I've tried. I was very skeptical, but this has certainly lived up to it's recommendation. I definitely recommend it.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Unfortunately I used this for years since it's sulfate and paraben free. However it has DMDM hydantoin!!! This is no better than using tresemme. Look up the lawsuits and save your hair. I switched to hempz shampoo and conditioner
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;My husband used this product, and his scalp was very irritated.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I started noticing hair loss after a few times using this shampoo and conditioner. At the time I didnt think none of it until my shower got clogged. When I unclogged it and seen the amount of hair I lost I wanted to cry. I immediately threw the product away and stopped using it. I then googled what causes hair loss and seen that this product contains DMDM hydantoin and sodium chloride. Which both ingredients are bad for your scalp & causes hair loss.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I used it for 3 times now. It's really good shampoo. The only negative thing - the smell is too strong.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I can't honestly rate this for how it works but I will tell you if you don't like that fake coconut smell that smells like a car air freshener, you will hate this smell.  It's just like it.  Must return.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;After using the shampoo and conditioner for only one week, my hair has so much volume and looks healthy!  I am not losing hair as I was before.  So impressed with this product!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This product smells great and leaves my hair soft
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I've been using this shampoo for a few weeks now, because I wanted my hair to feel thicker and more voluminous. The first few times I used it, I thought my hair looked super shiny and clean. As I've continued to use it, I've noticed a drastic REDUCTION in my hair's volume. My hair is so limp and feels incredibly thin now. The shampoo smells good and it does make my hair shiny, but it is not worth all the fall out!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;So I tried switching to different shampoos and conditioners to see differences, and I always go back to this!! The only shampoo and conditioner that leaves my hair so soft and healthy feeling. My hair grew the longest when I used this. Will always stick with it!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Seriously like food for my hair!! Thankful & please do not change formula or do anything with this product! Life changing!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I purchased this after seeing thousands of great reviews of several sites. I question if the reviews are legit because this stuff is terrible! The shampoo along with the conditioner will dry out your hair! My hair was so dry, coarse and difficult to straighten with a straightener after using this. Usually after shampooing and conditioning, your hair immediately becomes softer and you can run your fingers through it. I couldn't run my fingers through my hair at all in the shower with the conditioner that goes along with this shampoo. The texture / fragrance of this stuff reminds me of something you'd find at a cheap discount store. It is not worth the price. I am throwing both bottles out and purchasing new ones because it is ruining my hair!!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Dried my hair out severely and made it start falling out! I've always been super self conscious of my thin hair and now it's worse than before. So disappointed.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I wash my hair twice a week while it stays full and soft and  feeling good with how my hair feels.  With what I was using left a coating and flats on my hair and I lost more hair.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;"I honestly am torn between liking and disliking this product. The shampoo and conditioner does what it's labeled to do, my hair is noticeable thicker and has more texture. However, it's almost thick to the point where it has lost all natural shape and bounce and just wants to poof out like a box around my head. It's almost crunchy. On top of that, the product leaves a waxy film on your hair and on your skin that is impossible to rinse out completely. I guess that's what makes your hair feel ""thicker""? It smells really strong too, like reallyyyy strong. I like the smell because it reminds me of warm vanilla sugar, but sensitive users beware. Like I said, does the job, but due to its quirks I will not be repurchasing."
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I bought this shampoo and conditioner desperately looking for something to help me with my rapidly thinning hair.  My hair has gotten so thin that I can see my scalp throughout it so I was hoping to find a product to help add volume.  At first the product was really helping my hair look great, and then I started to notice a film being left on my scalp after showering no matter how well I rinsed my hair.  This film made my hair feel grimy and my scalp was itchy....so the search for a perfect shampoo and conditioner continues.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Where has this been my whole life!!! It smells amazing, my hair feels so much thicker, shinier, so soft and not frizzy at all. I love love love this formula.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Smells nice but made my hair feel incredibly dry. I have tried other organix products and loved them but the collagen ones just dry out my hair for some reason.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;i was a little sceptical about trying it because of all the bad reviews but i figured hey why not my hair was already falling out ALOT and i mean literal bunches of hair i was so depressed about it and decided to give it a try let me tell you i was so happy to see only a couple hairs go down the drain after i showered i also noticed it helped with the itching on my scalp i was so sick of using head and shoulders it made my hair stink! this one smells sweet like vanilla :) the only bad thing is it does make your hair dry so i use the ogx coconut serum for that  , other than that i love how full my hair feels now and also how much it stopped falling out
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I used this shampoo religiously for two or three years now. I loved the smell and it gave good softness and volume to my thin, fine hair. I recently noticed more and more of my hair falling out in the shower and began to fear the worst, like a hormone issue, until I happened to read a review for this shampoo and everyone else was mentioning hair loss. Put it in the trash immediately and moved on to a new brand and the hair loss is slowly stopping but it's going to be a long journey to get it back to normal.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This shampoo turned into gel after two weeks! It's super sticky now and can't be washed out of my hair. It was even hard to get off of my hands. The first few uses were good but i had to throw it away after only a few weeks
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I was using this shampoo and conditioner for a while because I have fine hair, and lack of volume, so it seemed like a great solution! I started using it for a few months and noticed the hair appeared to be thicker, and slightly more voluminous. However, shortly after, I got my hair colored and bought some salon quality shampoo and conditioner to protect the color and used that. Flash Forward, the salon hair product is gone and I switch back to this product. I didn't think anything of it at first, I noticed my hair didn't feel as soft but wasn't too bothered by it. A few days of using it and I'm noticing my hair will not stop getting greasy by the end of the day! With the salon product I could easily go two maybe three days without washing, with this product I can barely go one. It's irritating for me because I'm not sweating profusely or working out in any way. The only difference is this shampoo/conditioner. Also I've notice it's difficult to run my fingers through my hair, as well as to brush it, And I definitely have an increase of tangles and knots. Like others have mentioned, it must be product build up in the hair. The other let down is the  conditioner formula is really thin and barely feels like it moisturizes my hair at all, somehow it feels more stripped of moisture after using it in the shower. honestly had it not been for my Salon product experience I might not have never noticed but I'm glad I did!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;"Have used for a long time. Definitely helps hair look and feel more full. Not a new formula. There was an additional Biotin kind that OGX launched called ""Extra Strength"" or something, but this Thick and Full Biotin one looks to still be the same."
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I have thick wavy hair that is naturally very soft and manageable. This shampoo and conditioner made it impossible to brush through or do anything with, and it left a sticky residue. My hair was very dry but greasy at the roots, and my hair feels a lot thinner than when I started using it.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Got this because it seemed to have good ingredients. Biotin, collagen, vitamins, etc. Is sold as sulfate free but the third ingredient is a sulfate. I use this product like I've used others and after using this my scalp is always itching, I'm starting to get flakes, and normally I wash my hair 2 times a week but since using this, I can't be the day after washing my hair is insanely oily. Idk what the issue is with this company and their products but I've had the same problem when I used their keratin shampoo a few years ago.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This left a heavy film on my hair that made it feel nasty and unmanageable. My hair started falling out because of this. I threw this and the shampoo in the trash.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This shampoo and conditioner stripped my hair.  My hair is naturally dry, anyway, and it took 3 months to restore it (let is grow out). I keep my hair short.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I couldn't figure out why my hair felt so terrible the past few weeks. Usually, it is smooth and doesnt take much to detangle. I thought there was something wrong with me, until I realized I had recently started using this conditioner. I threw it out, used a Wella conditioner last night instead, and my hair is back to normal, although now I have breakage  due to how much I had to comb through knots in my hair because of this conditioner. Skip this one people, save your hair
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Used the OGX Thick and Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo for YEARS, and it made a huge difference to improve the thickness of my hair. But the ingredients are now different, and... just no. Not the same. In the history of cosmetics and hair products, I've only ever encountered 2 products that were truly improved when the ingredients changed. This was not one of those 2 products. I'm not looking forward to the annoyance of finding a new shampoo.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;i like that this shampoo is sulfate free, i don't think it did anything for thickness, and the fragrance is a bit too strong but smells nice
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Love the smell, love the feel afterwards, less frizzy and easier to manage. LOVE THIS!!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Replay I feel different when only one use
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Please use caution with this shampoo. I had used OGX brand products in the past (Argan Oil), and never had issues. However, about a week into using this shampoo and conditioner I noticed a large amount of hair fall and actually noticed several completely bald spots on my head. It made my hair extremely dry, tangled, and unmanageable. I know some people love it and have no issues, but I really wish I would have read more reviews before using. I'm now devastated and trying to grow my hair back.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I was excited to try this da shampoo and conditioner because I have had good experiences with other products from this brand, however I am not impressed with this one. It made my hair feel very waxy/greasy and dried my ends out quite a bit. I have fine hair strands, but thick hair overall. It weighed my hair down rather than adding volume. Might work for other hair types but not mine particularly.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Ever since I discovered this product shampoo and conditioner in my local supermarket, that's all I ever use now. I leave a tad bit conditioner in my hair for manageability after I wash my hair. My hair is so soft and full looking. I've gotten many compliments how healthy my hair looks. Great Product !! Thanks
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This conditioner is very thin and has barely any slip which made detangling my curly hair very hard, I gave it two stars because it did make my hair grow faster because of the biotin but it is very drying, as soon as I step out of the shower my hair feels silicone-e and it definitely made my hair frizzier.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This product is literally the best. My hair started falling a lot and I'm only 22 and I had no idea why. I started investing in all these hair shampoos for thinning hair like purador and Moroccan oil shampoo but they all made my hair fall in clumps. There was so much hair in the drain. My friend told me to buy the ogx biotin shampoo and conditioner and let me tell you, the results were amazing! After one use there was literally 2 strands of hair in the drain when I was done. And the best thing is you only need a drop. A little goes a long way. It definitely helped my itchy dry scalp and I can feel my hair getting thicker. YOU GUYS MUST TRY!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Beware- this will make your hair fall out in CLUMPS in the shower. Will never use again!!!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I swear by OGX conditioner. Even when I treat my hair with heat every day, this helps keep the split ends away. It's always surprising to my hair stylist how I have almost no split ends.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I used Nioxin for about 3 months. I did get compliments about my hair looking thicker but it left my hair extremely dry and frizzy. The first day after using this, I received the same compliments but also was told my hair looked healthier! Definitely using this instead, plus I'm saving a lot of money!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Looking for a new shampoo. Not much better than what I used already.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Was recommended by a friend but doesn't work for me. Needed to use another product to get the tangles out and moisturize
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I see a lot of people asking about what kind of scent this is all the time, and it states that it is a floral. Could be true, but I would compare it smelling to Aquolina pink sugar perfume, or sugar Scentsy bar. One of the reasons I use this shampoo, is for the awesome scent!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Not recommended for curly/course hair
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I wanted to give this product a try because I was loosing hair by the hand fulls and my hair is getting very thin. After just the first few uses I notice no lose of hair my hair was smooth and soft. The more I use it I'm noticing it getting frizzy but only loose a few strands vs a ton. I will continue to use this shampoo and conditioner.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I used this multiple times & was never able to fully wash it out ever. It leaves my hair with a waxy residue that makes it impossible to run my fingers through or brush easily. It is therefore prone to tangling and breaking. I normally have fine, smooth, and somewhat slippery hair & while this product gave the appearance of volume, it was simply product buildup making the strands appear thicker. Would not recommend, I am throwing out the remaining product.

Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Been buying this shampoo since summer. Keeps your hair full & moisturized. Smells great!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I have damaged hair due to bleaching it over 8yrs. I recently went brunette. I've been looking for a shampoo to help with my hair. My hair is damaged and feels frizzy and dry. After reading the reviews on here, I wanted to give it a try. Let me tell youC best thing ever! My hair was soft after getting out of the shower. I didn't even struggle to brush my hair. I totally recommend it if you have damaged hair. If it doesn't work out for you, you can always return it.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I use this shampoo every day.  It is the best I have used as far as keeping my hair stronger and healthier
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;And i used to use it a lot. But yeah if you just want your hair to smell delicious buy it.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I've received comments and noticed the thickness and shine
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;"Honestly, I had high hopes for this shampoo.  After using it, I noticed my head itching.  Then I started to feel bumps.  At first I thought ""maybe it's something else"", so I tried a different shampoo for a few days.  My scalp got better.  Went back to this shampoo/conditioner and the bumps are back and my head itches."
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;"""Dimethicone (which is in this product) is used as a sealant against water and even air. It is not a natural ingredient, and its side effects are bad for our hair. It gives the hair the illusion of shine, but it is not the shine we want—it is a fake shine from the plastic."" DO NOT BUY!"
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;my hair has grown so much since i started using this shampoo in the summer. 10 times out of 10 if my friends haven't seen me in two weeks they always comment on how my hair has gotten even longer since they've seen me! but also note my hair is healthy and i have rarely used heat in about a year. so not sure the effects on damaged hair
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I wash my hair 2-3 a week.  The crown of my head has noticeable breakage and this shampoo is helping alleviate that.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This hasn't really done anything for my hair. It's fine as a conditioner, but I dont think it's a great choice if you're trying to repair damage.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;My hair was falling in bulk really bad and I read this shampoo was good so I decided to give it a try and iam really happy with the results. I had 2 bald spots on my head and hair is starting to grow back again...
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I tried out the shampoo and conditioner as my sister had just bought it and the reviews seemed very promising but this DRIED MY HAIR OUT SO BAD! My hair has never felt or looked more dehydrated and frizzy. I will say they both smelled very nice and felt hydrating while I had used them in the shower but I did not like the way my hair dried at all. Very disappointed.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I want to love this shampoo simply because of the smell, but everytime i wash, it leaves my hair dull and greasy. I thought maybe it was just when I blow dried, but even after letting it air dry, it looked terrible. It always feels like the stuff isn't fully washed out every.single.time. It's so frustrating!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This is literally the worst conditioner I've ever used. It leaves so much build up on my hair, it makes me cringe. It feels like I didn't wash the conditioner out, and I stood in the shower EXTRA to make sure I got it all out. The reason people think that this gives them volume is because it just leaves build up on your hair! Avoid this product like the plague.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I used this in conjunction with the shampoo. I found that my hair looks thicker and fuller. conditioner makes my hair feel very soft and helps with tangles.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Does what it says. Leaves hair looking fuller and thicker.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Light weight and takes a small amount to use. Make my hair softer and easier to comb after washing my hair.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Inexpensive and works great
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;After just 3 to 4 washes I can tell the difference. I've used biometrix full density and OGX works 10x better
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;These shampoo and conditions are the best.  Safe for color treated and keratin treated hair.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Smells great! Leaves my hair soft & manageable.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I have two large drawerfuls of shampoo and conditioner. I'm always on the hunt for a shampoo that will tame my frizzy hair but not make it flat. This shampoo not only leaves my hair looking healthy but leaves my hair looking full and thick
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I have naturally straight, thin, fine hair and I have been using this shampoo for about a week now and my hair definitely feels fuller and thicker. I personally alternate every other wash using a normal shampoo because I don't want my hair to become too full and thick. Highly recommend for those with thin hair!!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Literally the best shampoo ever! I was experiencing serious fall outs, horrible! Was looking for a good shampoo and saw this on the shelf at Ulta. I have tried really expensive ones and never got the result I was looking for- promises of soft, shiny and etc. never happened with other ones. This biotin shampoo and conditioner not only leaves my hair sooo soft - living in humid Texas- but also has reduced the fall outs drastically. By drastically I mean if I was loosing 100 hair a day now it is like 10 a day. I hope it stays the same for my hair and scalp. I ordered two more of the big ones. Thanks for the great product. Hope it helps other people. Btw my hair is colored and my husband is also enjoying this shampoo and conditioner.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I have thin hair, and I love using the shampoo/conditioner combo because it leaves my hair looking thick.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Love the smell of this shampoo. Leaves my hair looking beautiful.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I really like this shampoo/conditioner combo. Great smell, keeps my hair tamed and voluminous. I am a biolage fiend but I couldnt justify the price for them anymore. For jumbo sizes OGX is affordable for my budget and even better durring the Jumbo Shampoo & Conditioner sale. I like using this and then blowdrying my hair after with their OGX thermal protector silk blowout cream.

Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Smells like literal heaven. I cannot stop smelling it. BUT after i wash my hair with it, i can't smell it on my hair hours later like i can with other shampoos which makes me sad.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I love this   Conditioner  It works so well it's great for fine hair
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I have tried matrix, kenra, and redken. You wont find anything else that will give you more volume than this one.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;The shampoo made my hair really soft, but the conditioner dried it out. Honestly used this and the shampoo for at least 2 or 3 months and saw no change in my hair.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I noticed a big difference with my hair after about 3 weeks of use.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I mixed this conditioner with olaplex and L'Oréal professional deep conditioner and I love the way my hair feels. My hair stylist even noticed my hair has been growing out. Definitely saw a change in hair growth more than I did with the biotin vitamins I was taking
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This shampoo (and the matching conditioner) do make my hair feel soft, and the smell is great. But after 3 months of scalp acne I've decided that I need to change to something else. I've never had that problem before, and didn't even know that it could be a problem until now.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I have long fine color treated hair. After using the conditioner for a couple weeks I noticed my hair in my brush about 2x the regular amount and every time I ran my hand through my hair, I would have 5-10 strands in my hand multiple times. DO NOT BUY THIS if you want to keep your hair. I did like how my hair felt silky and felt light but it's totally not worth it haha.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Ever since Ive been using this product people have been asking me if I got hair extensions. It makes my hair look soo full. I use it with the marula oil conditioner - great combination as it keeps my ends hydrated. I also have a sensitive scalp in which most shampoos cause flaking but this shampoo doesnt irritate. So thankful to have bought this. Originally bought in store but will now be purchasing online religously :D
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Have bought this product before....it's great for body
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;After 6 weeks of use, my hair is not thicker and I still have no volume. My hair is smooth, but I was looking for some volume.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I love this product! Definitely my new go to conditioner. I have not tried the shampoo yet, but after this I'm definitely going to!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Honestly i love it! i had really dry scalp and this helped so much i tried many shampoos and conditioners and none seemed to work for me except this one! It made my hair super silky soft!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I bought the shampoo and conditioner and LOVE THEM! I have fine, thinning hair. This really plumps up my hair, smells great, and doesn't leave my hair greasy after a few hours. Smells yummy too!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Almost seems like a miracle. My hair is gorgeous after one use. Soft, bouncy and full of life.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;good
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I bought this product in February after reading some good reviews. I wanted to grow my hair out and add volume to it. Though this product did help me grow my hair, it broke me out SO BAD the minute I started using it and no matter what I tried, the breakouts were too big and aggressive. I've finally decided to stop using it because the outcome is not worth it. I would not recommend this to anyone, as there are many other products that can help you grow your hair that won't break you out severely!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This shampoo does what it says and actually the first week I used it I got two compliments on how long and great my hair looked. However, it's  not worth the rash and scalp acne it caused. At first I thought I could manage a little hairline acne but now my scalp is completely irritated and my sideburns are full of acne. This has only happened to me once before (with Herbal Essences products) so I wouldn't say I have a sensitive scalp or anything, this is just really harsh I guess.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This and the matching conditioner get the job done. I've been using them for 3 months. However, I personally didn't notice any dramatic changes. I don't really see any extra volume or a thicker/fuller effect on my hair, like the shampoo claims. Overall, it is a nice shampoo but I won't repurchase.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Eh wouldn't buy it again.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I love this product. My braiding stylist used it once after I ran out of my normal conditioner and I've been hooked. That was about a year ago. I love the smell and the price. My hair is thick and kinky. I am a 4a/b hair texture. Yes, it detangles too and I am very tender headed so I am a fan!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Daughter's hair has never looked this good or been this easy to take care of
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This conditioner smells amazing. But that's about all the positive I have to say about this. It leaves residue in my hair and is causing some buildup. It's also super drying and causing my hair to be slightly unmanageable when trying to comb out afterwards. I will continue to use in small amounts along with a leave in conditioner that I now have to use to make my hair manageable but I will not repurchase.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This shampoo smells amazing. It lathers well and feels good in the shower. However, it doesn't do much for adding volume or thickness to my hair. And I think it's a bit drying. The matching conditioner doesn't do much for the dryness either. Will probably use until it's gone but won't repurchase.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This conditioner instantly gets out all tangles and knots in my curly hair no matter how many days old it is!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I purchased OGX because it came recommended by a hairstylist friend. I have somewhat oily, fine, wavy/straight hair. This shampoo/conditioner leaves my hair so dry and it feels like I didn't wash all of the product out every time. Not fan. Smells nice and the conditioned is nice and thick.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Great quality shampoo at a great price. Plus, it smells amazing!! My hair feels so clean after using this shampoo, yet it's gentle and doesn't dry my hair out. It actually feels stronger.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;gave this shampoo/conditioner a go but did not become a fan. It made my hair greasy by the second day, the smell was not pleasant and it made my hair fallout. i WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS SHAMPOO/CONDITIONER.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I have fine hair and volume/body is always a concern. I saw a noticeable difference within 2 uses! I love this shampoo!!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I gave this shampoo/conditioner combo a go, and I totally hate it! It leaves a thick, almost waxy feeling to my hair afterwards and it weighs it down so much. I thought maybe I was using too much product, so I used less, but even then it still left a very unpleasant feeling to my hair after my hair dries. Not to mention my hair looks like a grease ball by day 2! I won't be repurchasing.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I'm unsure if it's the shampoo, conditioner, or a combination of both, but this certain line of OGX leaves my hair with a waxy, weighed down feeling afterwards. I've tried using less product (thinking I was using too much) but even then it leaves a unpleasant feeling to my hair. Not a fan!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Every time I shampoo my hair
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I use this shampoo every other day with the matching conditioner and have told friends about it. I love the full thickness it gives my hair!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I love this shampoo (along with the matching conditioner). I noticed my hair was fuller after one use. Gives much better results than some expensive brands I've tried. Will buy again!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;We used this as our girls weekend out! And we all loved the smell and how it made our hair feel. We all have different types of hair.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;"This product is full of harmful sulfates that WILL dry your hair out. Depending on the individuals hair, they may notice right away (first use) or they may not notice until multiple or even several uses. But this WILL damage your hair. Having hair that ""APPEARS"" thicker is not worth the possibility of going bald. I mean the amount of reviewers with an experience of hair falling out is enough to make you not want to take the risk anyway. This shampoo did nothing for my hair back when I used it but make it extremely dry, brittle, itchy, tangled, etc. IF YOU WANT THICKER OR LONGER HAIR JUST TAKE ACTUAL BIOTIN VITAMINS. Try the rice water technique. Try using less heavy products. There are a ton of other ways that worked for me. This just wasn't one of them."
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This shampoo dried my hair out so much and didn't give me any volume at all. My hair has always been really dry and thick so maybe it would work better on thinner or oily hair.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;My hair was thinning out a lot and I was starting to get worried. I've been super stressed and also breastfed my daughter for a year. Immediately after using my hair felt, clean fuller and thicker. I was shocked! I also purchased conditioner. And would recommend using both. I used just shampoo one time without conditioner and it felt fluffy. I'm so happy I found this!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I have purchase this product and was excited to try it considering the great reviews I read, after the first wash it left my hair feeling silky, soft and smelling good. I even noticed the boost in volume. Shortly after less then 2 weeks of using this product my hair began to fall out in HUGE clumps and it left my hair greasy and dry and at the ends.. I would not recommend anyone buying this if you have dry or straight hair..
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I wash my hair every other day and the volume it gives is great
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Left my scalp dry and flaky and my hair oily
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This product (and even the brand) have been so hyped by people around me that I decided to try it this semester.  Upon reading some other comments here, I FINALLY figured out I'm not the only one struggling with this shampoo!  Before using this product, I had thick, wavy hair that I loved.  Sure I've changed lengths and cut my bangs 4 times here and there, but I've never dyed it and the texture has always been the same.  I've been using this shampoo consistently for 4 months waiting for my thick hair to come back.  I'm a nightshower-er, so I use this right before bed.  Twice a week, I've been conditioning with their coconut milk conditioner.  I've been waking up the morning after itching my head like I have a terrible case of lice (even though I have NO bugs in my head and don't see any dandruff), and I continue to feel the urge to itch it throughout the entire day.  My scalp has been ridiculously waxy and greasy all the time as well, and it's gotten to the point where dried shampoo can't even dry all that gunk out for a few hours while I'm in class or at work.  Plus, the whole bottom half of my locks are all dried up, so having my hair down closely resembles a wet rat.  I wear my hair up most of the time to cover it.  It feels so good to know I'm not alone, and I'll DEFINITELY be trying a new product ASAP.
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This shampoo lathers so well! My hair feels and smells super clean! And most importantly, my hair looks thicker and more healthy. I actually got lots of compliments on my hair after using it!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I have 3b thin hair and I bought this product excitedly hoping it would give my hair the fullness i've always wanted but instead my hair ended up falling out in clumps :( didn't give the product 1 star because it probably works better on straight hair despite saying it works on any hair type and it smells really really good
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Don't use this product daily because it will ruin your hair. It will cause it to thin out. I have naturally thick hair and I used this product and my hair was ruined after continual use. Just don't use this product at all— there is much better out there!
Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Before I went natural I used to straighten my hair 24/7 every day and it broke off a chunk of hair unfortunately but this stuff fixed that and grew out my hair and made it more thicker!! I am now natural (3b curl type) and I still use this product and it still works just as good!!
Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse;Love it
Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse;I love this line of products but this isn't for my hair . it dried really hard and flakes . I like my curls to be bouncy and natural .
Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse;This works and locks curls in, but it is a stiff hold, so if you're not in to that, I would pass on this product
Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse;This mousse is amazing! It is the best mousse I have ever tried. It makes my curls very large and defined, while also softening them, and I never get the dreaded crunch that I often get with other mousses. It also smells great which is an added bonus!
Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse;I used this on wet hair and let it air dry. It leaves my hair so soft, bouncy, and light! No crunch at all... BUT this mousse gave me dandruff. I can't buy it again
Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse;I've needed a mousse to hold my thick and frizzy curls and decided to give this one a try. It doesn't disappoint. It took some trial and error to figure out how much your hair will need (at first I used way too much). The smell is nice too. I like that it's a light mousse but provides a good hold.
Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse;Overall it was a decent mousse. Smelled great felt good in my hair. Then it started weighing my curls down and I looked in the ingredients and realized there is dimethicone which is basically plastic. which explains why I've been losing more hair than usual.
Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse;This Product SUCKS.  it life my hair crunchy and dry idk how it has so many amazing reviews this literally reminds me of the drug store stuff used in middle school.. Very dissapointed
Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse;I personally have straight hair, but when I use this it gives me a lot of volume.
Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse;Great hold
Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse;I love this product
Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse;My naturally curly hair loves this stuff😍
Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse;I bought this looking for a glycerin free product that helped reduce some of the frizz in my very fine, flyaway curly hair, and and to give me some definition without weighing my hair down. I absolutely love it. My hair is shiny and defined, and the frizz is much reduced, with clumping still remaining on Day 2 post wash. Don't be afraid of the PEG-12 silicone - it's water soluble according to the Science-y Hair Blog.
Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse;I tried it with my Curlsmith soufflé and oil and cream and while I liked the results I wasn't crazy about my roots being sticky and flaky
Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse;This mousse provides basically no hold. When I applied to damp hair at first the product seemed very promising, but after my hair dried my waves looked very undefined.  Then I went outside on a 70 degree day with very minimal humidity and my hair got puffy. I thought the point of mousse was to provide less hold than a gel, but more hold than nothing.
Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse;Shelia
Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse;won't leave your hair dry or crunchy
Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse;It worked great the first day. But loves it on the second day.
Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse;its smells great! Love how its not sticky or leaves my hair crunchy. It doesn't weight my hair down either. My curls are bouncy.
Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse;I was looking for a product that wouldn't weigh my very thin permed hair down and after reading a comment left by another person that had similar hair type I decided to give this a try and I absolutely love it. It's lightweight, non sticky and does not weigh my curls down and the smell is amazing.
Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse;It only dries hair out if you put too much in your hair. I only put a little amount and I put little bit oil and then dry my hair.  Be careful not too put too much!
Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse;This made my daughters curls bouncy and beautiful
Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse;"This left my hair crunchy, I thought I maybe used too much as it dispensed way too fast, so used less next time and still was crunchy and fly away and too light. I need something to make my hair feel thicker and weightier and more moisturized.  this may work to ""lighten up"" someone with thick hair, but this was not for me"
Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse;Love the richness and the streigh of this moose!... decadent!
Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse;I wanted to try something different.  My hair is fine textured and curly but with different types of curl through out.  I also have eczema on my scalp as well.  I've notice that using it twice in a row made my scalp extremely itchy. To the point where it woke my up my scalp was so itchy.  I did a leave in conditioner treatment.  My hair also feels extremely dry.  It didn't hold the curl very long either.
Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse;I absolutely love the product itself. The smell is fantastic and isnt too heavy on my hair. The product doesnt have a strong hold, which is okay with me because I'm not the biggest fan of crunchy curls.
Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse;I use this with another product and my curls love it!
Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse;I use this product daily on my curly hair
Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse;Doesn't make my hair hard.
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;I have 2b/2c waves and I absolutely love this stuff. I don't typically go for super defined curls/waves so this is great for low effort beachy waves. I use it it when my hair is soaking wet and then just let it air dry. I do not recommend if you are looking for a lot of structure and hold but I would try it out if you want a quick styling product that still looks good day to day!
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;I purchased this, used as I was supposed to and I feel it did nothing for me. if anything it made my hair worse and flat.
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;Great product!!
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;I used as directed and added mousse from the same line.  It did absolutely nothing for my hair except made it bigger and frizzier.
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;"I'm lazy with my hair.  I don't blow dry, I don't toussel, I don't use hair spray or gel, etc etc.  I've always showered at night, wake up with decent hair, but by the end of the day, it's a greasy mess.  My hair is long, thick, wavy, slightly frizzy.  I have a ton of baby hairs.  I talked to my hairdresser and she recommended NBD by Redken.  My Ulta didn't carry it so I ordered it elsewhere.  I didn't like it.  It acted just like gel - not what I wanted.  I picked this up on a whim.  LOVE IT.  It's touchably soft, doesn't clump my hair together to ""hold"" it, it smells amazing, and doesn't weigh my hair down.  I get nice movement and volume.  I normally don't like coconut scents but I LOVE the scent of this.  I for sure will buy this again.  And I can't stress enough that I am a very low-maintenance hair person.  This stuff elongates the time I spend without having to resort to a ponytail."
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;This stuff is AMAZING!!! I spent days reading reviews on various drug store and name brand products, looking for something new to try for my frizzy, wavy hair. I decided to give this a try because it was a product I could get locally, and the price was reasonable. I've have tried many high end styling products but I really wanted to find something with a reasonable price tag. I checked it out in the store after reading mostly positive reviews, and my final deciding factor was that it smelled great. I apply one to one and a half pumps and work it through wet hair, scrunch, and allow it to air dry or dry it with my diffuser. This stuff works better than any of the expensive products I've ever tried! It leaves my (previously damaged from a bad due experience) hair soft, wavy, frizz free, and shiny!!
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;I got this because I love their coconut curls line (the conditioner is the BEST for getting tons of hydration to my dry 3b hair) I added this into my routine right after the styling milk, and all it did was make my hair dry and greasy at the same time (???). I really don't remember it doing anything positive at all. It sits on my shelve unused, a true shame since I really wanted to love it.
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;This curl cream is by far the best I have ever used....and I have tried many.  It gives great definition to the curls and completely takes away the frizz.  It leaves the curls soft and bouncy -- not crunchy.  And it smells amazing! This will be my go to for sure
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;This is one of the only products that works on my super thick, curly, and frizzy hair.
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;"I have fine wavy hair I normally use the OGX Moroccan argan oil curl cream w/ the argan oil mousse but I needed something I could scrunch my hair without having to diffuse it and I came across this cream at first I was hesitant because it contains Shea butter which can weigh my hair down but I noticed that it's glycerin free and wow that makes a difference I can now take a shower in the mornings and put this in my hair let it air dry and my hair dries soft, defined but not overly moisturizing and big  "" I live in FL = HUMIDITY "" this is definitely a quick product to use when your getting ready for work it gets the job done obviously your hair won't be perfect but it's decent for the work week I recommend it :)"
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;This hair cream makes my wavy hair feel soft and look healthy and shiny! It holds my curls all day. This cream smells great too.
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;I had ordered this online, and when it came the bottle and pump were separate. I put the pump into the bottle but it seems as if there are missing parts, so nothing came out of the pump. I have to pour it in my hands, which is fine, but if the pump worked it would be more beneficial.. This is not the first time an Ogx product has broke. However, it did make my waves bounce and create a tighter curl.
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;"This stuff surprised me -- it's simple, good, smells nice, it's not fussy.....essentially takes your hair's natural texture, wave pattern and.....let's it do it's thing without interfering much. Strange way to describe a product. Here's the deal: I have long, fine (fairly thin) hair. It can be QUITE curly if I ""coax"" it a lot (layer on leave-ins, cocktail creams and gels, diffuse for an hour, that sort of thing). BUT -- I don't want to spent 90 mins on my hair. I want to spend 5 minutes and let it air dry. I've been on the hunt for A SINGLE PRODUCT I can toss in towel-dried hair, let air dry and have ""reasonable""-looking hair. I know with one product I'm unlikely to get all the perks (probably not a combo of frizz-control, curl-definition, volume and hold exists in ONE PRODUCT), but I'd like to have ""nice-looking"" hair that doesn't need a hair dryer. BUT - this does a NICE job of taking my natural hair texture and ""preserving"" it while it dries. Very little hold, but some nice soft frizz control. Not amazing curl enhancement, but some small amount of volume. It doesn't so much ""change"" what my hair does so much as it ""stays outta the way"" and allows my hair to be wavy, beachy, it feels like there's NOTHING in my hair, there's ZERO cast, no-product feel, but definitely adds some volume and softness. I was *QUITE* surprised. Was looking for something to replace a Very Expensive Brand that gives you 5 oz of something that you'll tear through in a week. This seems to fit the bill. No heat required, some gentle definition, plenty of volume and hair that FEELS LIKE HAIR. Will be experimenting with using different amounts of this, but I'll definitely re-purchase. It ""does a little, very well."" Allows you to work WITH your natural hair, without requiring a lot of effort."
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;I have relatively easy curls to manage. Thinner hair with loose waves. Even still, this did nothing to take the frizz. Might be nice for a leave-in conditioner, but nothing more. Will be returning.
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;I love this. I've tried so many curl products for my wavy hair. I pretty much only use high end hair products but I tried this. It makes my hair really soft and defined. I hate it when curl cream leave a sticky residue and this doesn't. I have mid back length thick wavy and really dry and damaged hair.
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;Pump the product into the palm of your hand, rub product together with both hands, apply to clean/damp hair with focus on your ends.
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;I would definitely purchase this again.  I have always struggled with my hair, as it is not straight but not curly and when it air dries I look like Mufasa!  hahaha So I always flat iron my hair!  Well... I have finally found something that does not weight down my hair or make my hair greasy or crunchy.  I literally towel-dried my hair and then used this and scrunched my hair.  After allowing my hair to air dry, I actually don't hate it!  This is a big deal, people!  I think I may lay off the flat iron a bit.  :-)
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;smells good and the thickness of the product is good and doesn't weigh my hair down
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;I have used different kinds of curl products and I'm pretty amazed at how this is pretty good, not crunchy, very very low cast, price is good.
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;I use on my damp hair and just scrunch it through my hair and let it air dry
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;I usually love OGX products especially the smell, but unfortunately this one was not pleasant and really just gave me a headache.
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;I've been looking for something to give me defined waves and not just weight them down or give me an overly oily look. This cream does the job and it's great for air drying or defusing. I've even used it as a touch up cream for in between days to tame frizz.
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;This product doesn't weigh my fine, wavy hair down but manages to provide good definition and hold. My hair air dries soft, touchable and manageable. Best of all, it doesn't have silicones, so it's CGM friendly. Unfortunately it does have polyquats, so I have to clarify a little more often. I use this in conjunction with the Ouidad gel and my hair stays good for 3 days--that never happens.
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;I don't have curly hair, I have very naturally straight hair with some little wave underneath if I let it air dry. I just used this as more of combing cream and I loved it. I don't blow dry my hair unless it's a special occasion or I'm in a hurry and my hair dried very soft and I think it may have added just a small amount of body. It smells great too! I know its not made for straight hair but I would definitely buy it again.
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;You can use this product right after you shower and let your hair dry naturally. It will leave your curls looking healthy and bouncy.
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;I would use this product after i got out of the shower. My hair is wavy, more on the curlier side. It did make my hair smell nice, but didn't enhance my curls. Even after I diffused it, it didn't give me what other products do for my curls.
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;"I have medium strand, medium density waves with random spirals. It gets weighed down easily but still needs a lot of hold to be frizz free, so it's hard to find that happy medium on a lower price point. This comes close, when I use a lot of it. For chin-to-collarbone length hair (layers), I use two full pumps, one for each side of my hair, and air dry. It's enough that I have to scrunch to ""soften"" the curls. The smell is a little annoying, but it fades. I've had this stuff for a few months and can't decide if I will repurchase, but I'll at least finish the bottle. Also, this stuff sucks with diffused heat or as a cream to scrunch out crunch from gel/mousse."
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;This truly helped to tame my frizzy wavy/curly hair during air drying! I mix it with the other curling cream (white bottle) by this brand and LOVE it!
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;I air dry my hair nearly every day. My hair is wavy (2B) and average density and thickness. I use a mousse for my hair, but wanted something to prevent frizz better. This product smells great and applies easily even on dry hair (tried this as a last resort). Unfortunately, my hair soaked this product up very quickly and it did nothing. If anything, touching my hair when applying this product just made me lose my normal wave definition. Maybe on finer or thinner hair this would work better?
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;I've been trying to find something to work with my diffuser and this gets the job done well. I tried the air drying and it left my hair pretty frizzy. But when done with a blow dryer my ways and curls come out with barely any frizz. I would highly recommend for people with wavy/frizzy hair.
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;I like this product, but I noticed I still have quite a bit of frizz, but I'm not going to give it a bad rating because maybe my hair just needs time to heal from so many years of blow drying and straightening it. If any one has tips on how to help with the frizz, please let me know!
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;"My daughter has very curly but FINE hair, which means it tangles and frizzes easily.  This styling aid was very lightweight and moisturizing and it didn't make her hair feel crunchy or sticky (which is why she tends to avoid any kind of product).  It maintained curl separation without looking ""wet.""  It smells like summer vacation, and it's affordable.  It's our new go-to styling aid."
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;I recently cut my hair short, and I wanted a cream or oil that will nourish it days I won't straighten it. This product is amazing! It leaves my wavy hair shiny, soft, and nourishes it so much!! The price is great as well!! Highly recommend this product.
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;This product has been great so far. Super lightweight and it gives me very natural looking curls. They are still defined and not as frizzy with no crunch and not greasy at all. LOVE!!
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;Is pretty good, is really oily and it gives the hair a healthy natural look, but it kinda feels like you don't have no product at all.
Locking + Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream;My kind of product. I have curly, frizzy, and (with age) now finer hair, and this is my favorite. I wash it, squeeze the water out with towel, comb, apply 3 pumps of this, scrunch, and go!!!!! The end result is the best of any product I have tried. Doesn't even feel like I have any product in my hair at all. My curls are shiny and not stringy with less frizz. I love it!!!
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;I discovered this oil about 3 years ago and I have never used a different oil since. I have very curly very long hair and it gets incredibly dry. I apply this oil to my hair when wet before putting any other styling products in and I can really see/feel a difference when I forget this step. my haircare routine would not be complete without it. I do not recommend this for anyone with thin or fine hair, but if you have thick dry curly hair like mine, I would highly recommend. my hair just saoks this up and leaves me with bouncy, glossy curls without oily residue and with minal frizz.
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;Love how my hair is so soft and looking healthy with shine.
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;Had used this product through the winter and enjoyed it. As soon as the summer came around and I started working outside again my hair completely fried after using it. It took months for it to finally stop but would clump into dried strands as if I left shampoo in and let it dry. Won't be buying from OGX again as I've had nothing but problems with their products that continuously damage my hair.
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;Repairs damage and leaves hair so soft! I have been using this on my bleached hair and it has done wonders!
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;Literally brings my hair back to life, it keeps my hair looking shiny and throughout there is no sign of dryness.
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;Is this safe for color treated hair?
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;makes hair soft and gets rid of frizz! smells like coconuts obviously!
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;Got dry hair that looks like straw? Then this will help! Now it's a small bottle, so don't dump it in your hair. Work it in the midsection and the ends of your hair. I should know. I got dry stringy hair. But this stuff really does work! And it makes it very soft and it smells good!!!!!! I love it! I just wish the bottles were bigger. I'm on my 4th bottle in 8 months which isn't bad at all. Try it and you'll love the results.
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;This products gives my hair shine and keep it soft. I use it after towel drying my hair and the next day. My hair doesn't not get weight down and it feels healthier. I  am a tropical girl so the scent doesn't bother me.
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;It makes my hair sooo silky!! I have long thin hair that tangles easily and it helps with that and doesn't make it feel weighed down.
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;I love the smell, but it weighs down my hair too much. I don't use a lot at all. It makes my hair feel greasy everywhere, however I only use it on my ends. I like this brand and will try another product, but this just didn't work for me
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;I use this on the days when I'm letting my hair air dry and doing minimal styling. It smells amazing and makes my hair SO soft and smooth. I plan to use this oil forever!
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;Smells lovely, really helped with my dry ends.
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;It works really well! Smoothed my hair/fly aways and smells like coconuts.
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;My daughter loves this oil.  She really loves the smell.
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;"I've been using the product for about a month and I must say it's 1000000% worth the purchase. I have drier hair since I've always had highlights or balayage in my hair. So the ends lack moisture and sometimes when it dries it looks so fried and frizzy but when I put this treatment in my hair, it dries and immediately feels so soft. Just like that ""leaving the salon"" feeling. I can't recommend it enough."
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;Put on after shower and after I styled my hair.
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;When I get out of the shower, I put this all over my hair and I let it air dry and it makes my hair super soft!! I would recommend if you have any hair type!!
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;this has made my hair so much better. normally it's frizzy and feels bad but with this when it air dries omg!!!! not frizzy and feels so so soft
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;My hair is long and thick and was very rough at the ends. I bought this product from Ulta and use it every night after my shower. I put a dime size amount in my palm and rub halfway down my hair to the ends. I rub it in very good or it'll just sit on your hair. Leaves hair very soft, shiny and smells so good!!
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;I love this oil. I use in damp hair out of shower before blow drying and it completely smooths out my hair and makes it soft as silk. I am a licensed hair stylist so i'm skeptical about some products at the drugstore when it comes to ingredients, but this product has minimal ingredients and coconut oil is the 4th ingredient it seems. Honestly this product is not bad at all and you get a ton of product. I only use like a nickel sized amount in damp hair. It does NOT weigh my hair down. The oil is on the lighter side for me and I have blonde, lighten hair. So if anyone is looking for a good oil for shine, softness and split ends this one is good. I will continue to repurchase.
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;I've used this product a few different times so far and every time I do it leaves my hair silky smooth and smelling amazing. Even my ends that are really dry right now look much better after using this. I only use a small amount as the directions state and it's perfect. I'll definitely continue to use this.
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;I really love this product. I literally tried it today, so I've only used it once, but I instantly noticed a difference in my hair. My hair was frizzy and dry, and it instantly tamed down a lot of the frizz and gave my hair a nice shine. Highly recommend this!
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;Its great for my  everyday  use
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;I love the smell, a little goes a long way, it's cheap, and it works on my hair
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;best oil i've used on my hair after straightening or cutting it, use on bottom of ur hair especially if hair is naturally curly
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;This Product Was Created For This Type Of DNA
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;i put a quarter size in the palm of my hand and rub in my hair after a shower. Makes my hair super soft, and easy to brush.
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;I heard so many great things about this oil and finally bought it. Wow! It's amazing, I have thin fine hair that I keep platinum blonde and I'm a brand snob and super picky about the products I use on my hair. I don't like letting my hair air dry because the bottom would kind of frizz up and I hated it. I use this on my towel dried hair and my hair air dries smooth and frizz free, it's beautiful and smells great too. Just know a little goes a long way, plus the price is great too.  I will forever buy this oil.
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;I've bleached my hair so as a result it's a bit dry. I have super wavy, frizzy hair. This helps tame it and gives it shine and moisture all while smelling amazing and it doesn't t leave me hair looking greasy like other oils I've tried.
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;I was worried that this oil would make my hair greasy. I have really thick hair as well. i put a little on my hands and gently ran it through damp hair and even put a TINY amount on the top of my head. not much. the ends of my hair are extremely dry. I enjoy this product.
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;My 2nd time purchasing this product helps my hair replenish lost moisture and dryness due to over processing. It smells wonderful! Makes me feel like I'm on a tropical island.
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;I haven't used this too much but when I have it's done nothing but do what it's supposed to do.
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;love this stuff.  i have fikne grey hair that i highlight blonde andbit dries my hair.  this adds shine and restores the silkiness to my hair.  i tried more expensive brands with less results.
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;I love this product hands down! It smells amazing and makes your hair smooth and shiny! If you have wet hair, add in this product, let it air dry , and straighten your hair or even just let it be it looks and feels smooth shiny and soft! It's definately worth the price
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;Love this stuff right out of the shower to add some shine,manageability and detangling hair. This along with the shampoo and conditioner are great for the winter or dry climate. Doesn't help with static. But it does help to keep your hair soft,shiny and moisturized in the times your hair needs it the most. This works just as well as some of those high end higher priced salon hair polishes and you don't get product build up with it or find that it just stops working for you and doesn't quite do the trick anymore. I have been using this for years when I travel to really dry climates or in the winter when my hair needs that extra boost of moisture the most.
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;I absolutely love this stuff. I was looking for products to help bring out the curl in my hair and this stuff does really well. It's nice and light and adds a nice hold to my hair, while keeping it nice and soft. 100% would recommend!
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;This product made my bleached dried out ends beautiful. It's not heavy and it makes your hair so silky this is the best product I've ever tryed
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;I've been using this product since the line stopped selling the coconut milk creme leave in conditioner. This was not my first choice but it does work well. This product has silicones in it. You have to make the choice whether or not it will be too heavy for your hair. For me, I put this in RIGHT AFTER I take a shower. On gently towel dried hair. I never use this product on my dry hair because for me, it's too heavy. It will absolutely soften and change the feeling of your hair. I wanted to write a review because, after about 2 months of not using it and absolutely hating how my hair felt, I have repurchased it and my hair is back to it's usual softness. It's like a dream, and it really does smell so good. Compare it to the Paul Mitchell Super Skinny serum but with a different scent. USE SPARINGLY. A LITTLE GOES A LONG LONG WAY. One container will last me at least 6 months.
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;I've used this oil for a while now and have purchased more than one bottle because of how much I enjoy it! It lasts a long time so even though the bottle is a little small it goes a long way, for me it will last at least three months if not more. What I do is add a small amount in my hands and rub it on the ends of my hair while it's still wet everytime I step out of the shower, I feel it has improved my damaged sections and helped my hair grow a bit quicker than it would without it. It smells super good and the smell isn't too strong and it lasts in your hair until the next wash.
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;I seriously love this oil! It's one of two OGX products I use for protection from split ends and heat styling. It does the job and helps to curb breakage/splitting in my hair. And it smells great! I like to use it during the warmer weather months as the scent seems to go accordingly. It is thick, just like the other penetrating oils, so a little of it goes a long way. It's a wonderful and effective product that I continue to purchase.
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;my hair has been through so much, so thought i'd give this oil a try. it was fantastic, helped my hair recover from perming & coloring
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;Love this product it puts shine in my hair and helps  the frizz
Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil;Love the smell and lightness of the oil great on my hair esp bangs!
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;Love this dry shampoo.  The smell is wonderful and no tangles in my hair.
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;Smells amazing, but does nothing to absorb oil.
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;I normally have to wash my hair everyday because it gets greasy so quickly. I decided to purchase this because I've put in a fashion color and want to make it last more than two days. :) I am now on day 6 of not washing my hair and have used the product 4 times. My hair feels clean and my scalp is not itchy. It smells good too! This is all in the midst of a humid Kansas summer, so I'm definitely sold on it.
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;Although some dry shampoos take out the oil they leave your hair looking flat which is a big no for me. This product not only takes out all the oil from your hair but it gives a beautiful voluminous look ! I love it and would really recommend :)
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;I got this because I was looking for a cheaper but reliable alternative to the $25 dry shampoo I usually use. my hair is super thin, damaged, and bleached/colored so I only wash it like once a week. But I'm a very outdoorsy person living in a humid area, so dry shampoo is a staple product for me. I actually like this better than the other dry shampoos I've tried at this price point, it's not disappointing compared to the pricey dry shampoo, and THE SMELL IS AMAZING oh my GOSH. I absolutely love it.
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;My only problem with this dry shampoo is the scent
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;My fine blonde hair usually requires every day washing. I just bought this this week and am not on my second day of no washing and my hair feels like I washed it thoroughly this morning with no dry shampoo residue feel. And it has VOLUME! HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend. I just ordered my second bottle
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;I use this every other day
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;I have lots of fine hair- it can get oily quickly. This allows me to go a few days between washes. Smells great. Blends & brushes through my hair evenly. It feels fresh and clean.
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;Love this dry shampoo! I can finally stretch my hair between washes now and my hair no longer feels oily, greasy or collects buildup.
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;I really wanted to like this because it had great reviews and the price is better than what I usually pay for dry shampoo (drybar). It made my hair really greasy and didnt work at all. Smelled amazing though
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;This was one of the first dry shampoo's I ever tried and it's an all time favt!  Recommend shake before use, spray on area an massage in with fingers. Also great to spritz lightly into hair after work, hubby will love the fragrance an it's a great way to take the work day away an quickly freshen your look.
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;Feel in love with this at first use. I wash once a week and use dry shampoo on the daily. This works beautifully and has an amazing candy scent. Husband loves to bury his face in my hair while we cuddle and watch tv every night. This dry shampoo is one of his favs. It also works great at oil control and adds a bit of volume. Adore it! Only complaint is I would really like a larger can.
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;It was so beyond sweet smelling and overpowering. I usually love the OGX dry shampoo but this one was way too much it gave me a headache. It would have been nice if it was a bit lighter of a scent since it's good at absorbing oil.
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;I have only used this a couple of times since I have purchased it, but so far, I do like it and it smells really nice!!
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;Not sure why rated do high.. smells meh, doesnt last and leaves bad residue.
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;Love this product, no white residue and smells amazing!
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;NO white residue on dark hair and best smelling dry shampoo ever! Cotton candy and vanilla bliss while absorbing oils in between washes.
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;This is probably the best smelling dry shampoo I've ever used. There is some whitecast but it brushes out super easily. I will say it leaves a pretty significant build up, but if you're ballin on a budget like me this is pretty good for the money and smells WORLDS better than any other budget dry shampoo I've tried.
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;this made me look like my hair was dusty🤣 also, for some reason, i thought this was supposed to have glitter in it? That's on me I guess. Not sure where I got that. But it's not. It does smell good🤷🏻‍♀️
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;This spray doesn't work as well as Batiste when I've been sweating at work all day but it works really well as an after styling spray to create volume and prevent oiliness. I like the way it smells, it's a sweet pick me up.
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;It does absolutely nothing! I've used dry shampoo for ages and usually buy batiste, but I decided to give this a try because they were on sale. I regret buying two. I sprayed my hair so much and kept brushing it in and my roots still looked greasy. I've never had this problem with any other dry shampoo and I've tried a couple brands. Some make me itchy, some leave a white cast, but to not have it absorb any of the oils in my hair.... it's a first. I only skip one day in between washes, so my hair isn't too oily either. I must have used half the bottle the first try. Don't waste your time. Only positive is the scent
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;Love the scent and it lasts a LONG time. It soaks up the oils, but also acts like a texturizing spray. I never get a cast from it either. I'm getting back ups because I'm in love
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;I don't really use dry shampoo but I bought the shampoo and conditioner and love the smell. So I figured I would give this a try and I love it too!!
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;This stuff smells heavenly but it's a bit drying & leaves a white cast on darker hair. Like most OGX Dry Shampoos it fits a great job of absorbing oil.
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;Smells great.  Easy to use.  Also great for texture.
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;I purchased one and I want a back up. Your hair smells amazingly yummy!
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;Works well and smells great. It doesn't have a weird lingering over powerful scent either.
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;I didn't use it and gave it way because of the smell. It smelled like cheap perfume
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;This product smells so amazing and as a dry shampoo it works so well. It gives a lot of volume to your hair and allows your hair to go an extra day or two without washing it without leaving a bunch of residue on it.
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;I do like this dry shampoo, it does what I need it to do. It smells good, but not like cotton candy and pineapple which is one of the biggest reasons I bought it. The smell also isn't very strong. I much prefer not your mothers coconut dry shampoo. That's even more effective at taking away all the oil and the smell is very prominent and sweet.
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;It works great and smells good but made my hair suuuuuper staticky
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;Smells delicious but makes my hair dry and sticky. I can't even run my hands through my hair
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;I do love this, because the smell is way better than most dry shampoos. And it doesn't leave a white cast in my dark hair. My only complaint is that it's a bit strong, so if you spray too much it can be overwhelming.
Kandee Pop Glam Mermaid Dust Dry Shampoo;Smells SO good. Very sweet smelling. As soon as I saw cotton candy and pineapple I had to try it. I usually get the coconut one, but this scent is quickly my favorite. I might just get the Shampoo and Conditioner even though I don't have colored hair, it smells that incredible.
Blonde Enhance + Purple Toning Drops;I've used OGX products for years, so I was excited to try this product. However, after weeks of thinking I had developed some serious summer mascne, turns out my face/neck broke out in a big, bumpy rash because of this product. I used a different shampoo and conditioner yesterday, and the bumps started to clear up. I'm not sure if I'm allergic to one of the ingredients, but it was terrible. Plus, it did not lighten my natural blonde hair very much compared to other people who used the product on their natural blonde hair.
Blonde Enhance + Purple Toning Drops;I love this stuff I am super lucky I found a product that takes the brassiness  away  my hair is naturally dark blonde I got it dyed professionally it looks like a honey blonde but I told the people I wanted it exactly only 3 shades lighter it looked reddish/brownish.it was suppose to look a little more blonde.so I went on ulta beauty website I love it so much!no more brassiness my hair is golden like it should be.no split ends and breakage.and my hair feels stronger and healthier seriously really.thank you Jesus.8
Blonde Enhance + Purple Toning Drops;I loved the concept but it did not help when I added drops to my Biolage shampoo.
Blonde Enhance + Purple Toning Drops;I a brunette with balayage. I like that I can buy this and add it to my shampoo/conditioner to just use on my ends vs having regular and purple shampoo/conditioner. It also controls how much you tone. It's worked really well for me. I mix it with redken shampoo/conditioner.
Blonde Enhance + Purple Toning Drops;Excellent product. Love I can just add to favorite shampoo
Blonde Enhance + Purple Toning Drops;Gave this a try after disappointing results from different purple shampoos, conditioners and masks. Added it to a creamy leave in conditioner and it did reduce the brassiness.
Blonde Enhance + Purple Toning Drops;I use this in my dry hair and don't rinse out I squeeze some drops either in a styling product for volume or I don't add to anything and I use as many drops as I like and it's awesome how much it tones but be careful can go overboard and get purple spots and when doing it this way pay attention to really blend /work into hair strands.
Blonde Enhance + Purple Toning Drops;I love switching up my shampoos but it's hard with blonde hair. This is a game changer! I can add it to my favorite shampoos and tame the brassy blonde. I absolutely love it.
Blonde Enhance + Purple Toning Drops;"I colored my hair in January and by now, with no chance to color it again, I was starting to feel unhappy with the blond. so I decided why not, I used this with my ""Not Your Mother's Matcha Green Tea & Wild Apple Blossom Nutrient Rich Butter Masque"" and for the first time I used WAY more that 5 drops, but i absolutely LOVE the result as my hair looks straight out of the salon. I will be definitely using less drops next time, just for maintenance, but so far I´m really happy I got it as purple shampoo was just blah!"
Blonde Enhance + Purple Toning Drops;I absolutely love this stuff. I used it one time in the shower and my blonde has already lightened two shades!!!
Blonde Enhance + Purple Toning Drops;I'm a natural dirty blonde but I frequently bleach my hair and I also have microlink extensions in. My hair doesn't turn brassy quickly but I haven't kept up maintenance due to everything going on with Covid (and laziness). I also fake tan and am not as careful as I should be so my extensions and natural hair will become stained from that. Anyways, I bought these drops on a whim and I'm obsessed. I shampooed as normal and then added the drops to a leave in conditioner and only let them sit for maybe five minutes. My hair is back to my icy blonde after only one use and it doesn't feel dry like most purple shampoos can cause. I will definitely be repurchasing and you can't beat the price!
Blonde Enhance + Purple Toning Drops;I have thick, wavy blonde hair that is colored (I'm naturally a really dark/dishwater blonde now) and some purple stuff does NOT work on my warm hair. It's stubbornly warm. I mixed a few pumps purple conditioner with 3 drops of these drops and worked it through each section of hair. And I have a lot of hair, so I used a LOT of purple conditioner + these drops. I applied it to dry hair and let it set about 40 min or so. Then I washed with clarifying shampoo and conditioned it really well. Adding the purple drops to the purple conditioner was an amazing pre-wash hair treatment which made my hair so silky... AND it really toned my hair! I can't believe how cool toned it is now! So..... buy this!! It's a deal!
Blonde Enhance + Purple Toning Drops;I've been using this for about a week and just started to see more dimension in my naturally wavy blonde hair.  I use 5 drops in conditioner and sometimes more.  It has helped reduce the brass look my hair got over the winter.
Blonde Enhance + Purple Toning Drops;These purple drops by OGX are awesome! I've used purple shampoos from salon brands to drugstore brands and these drops work way better! I love being able to add them to my favorite shampoo and conditioner. They remove the yellow & brassy tones from my icy blonde hair color.
Blonde Enhance + Purple Toning Drops;I use purple shampoo, so I added to my conditioner. I saw no difference in my hair. Not worth buying.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I have easily oily hair. I use it on the morning to tame bed head hair. my hair gets oily easy and my scalp aches with too much conditioner or product. This stuff does not weigh me down or cause oil or heaviness. I love it. Bought back up bottles. It detangles. Can't say enough good.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I love and recommend this stuff. I have oily hair. Can't use much conditioner because it weighs my hair down then my scalp hurts.  Same with much product. This stuff is awesome tho. I use this on my hair in the morning to comb out my bed head hair. Have no issues with weighing it down at all. Does not look greasy. Adds a bit of shine. Detangles as well. Highly recommend!
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I struggled w frizz hair my whole life, this totally controlled the frizz, I've tried other Ogx hair serum like the coconut oil made my hair frizz sm, this one doesn't, I couldn't imagine my life without it. Gives my hair thickness, non frizz hair
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I was worried because the shampoos by ogx are not the best, and I recently stopped using them. I bought this and used as an after-shower hydration oil. It kept my hair shiny, soft and overall softened my dry ends. I only used a nickel sized amount in my wet hair and it lasted me like 3 or 4 months. I'm buying more again, but I think it depends on your hair type because other oils make my hair very greasy and stiff.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;This product makes your hair look shiny & soft, but after using it for a couple weeks I noticed my damaged hair got extremely dry & brittle. Wouldn't recommend.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I style my hair and apply just a few drops of this oil oil for some shine. It makes my hair feel so soft, shiny and of course it smells amazing. Also Gus product doesn't make your hair feel sticky like some other hair oils. I definitely recommend this product!
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;This is a great mosturizer for dry hair. Applies easily with wet hair. Smell is sutle and nice.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;Heads up: this is not an oil! It's a serum. It's not going to moisturize your hair, but it's incredible for making it shiny, smell good, and frizz-less. If you want an oil that will actually moisturize your strands, OGX doesn't have that. Use 100% pure oils (from The Ordinary or SheaMoisture). I use this product along with Jamaican castor oil on my ends and love it. This doesn't make it look oily, so it's great to put on in the morning to help my ends and my little frizz on top of my head, and then comb the excess through my hair so it's smooth and shiny.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I tried this product on my hair for several months, and I feel like it did NOTHING for my hair. It made my hair dry, brittle, frizzy and caused dandruffs. I also couldn't stand the smell. I threw it in the trash where it belongs. If I could give this product zero stars I would. I don't recommend this product.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;i would not recommend ANY of the ogx products except for their shampoo+conditioner. this product contains bad silicones that could potentially make your hair fall out.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;"Gave it two stars because is smells ok but it didn't ""heal"" my hair. I don't get why this has so many good reviews? There are better oils out there"
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I love this spray because other oils are too heavy for fine, thin hair.  Great control, so hair is not too oily.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I have been using this for over a month and my hair looks healthier and feels less dry on my ends. And it's not too pricey for the good product that you get. You don't have to use much either and it smells great!
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I've got long, curly hair and this works quite well for detangling or adding some shine to the ends. Smells good too!
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I've been growing my hair out and the longer it gets, the dryer it becomes. This oil works wonders! I highly recommend!
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;this thing WORKS! i always use this after i wash my hair and when i wake up the next morning my hair is so curly, so smooth, and shiny! but i would not recommend using this as a heat protectant or after you style your hair, just use a spray.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;Great product & affordable..
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I have thick wavy easily oily hair. I can't go very many days without washing but I prefer to. I can't use conditioner much because my scalp starts to hurt the next day when I do. Decided to try this and love it. Doesn't weigh my hair down. I use it after I blow it straight. Calms the frizz and adds a bit of shine.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I've already noticed changes only after a week using this product. My hair is shiner and looks and feels healthier. Get this!
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I have been using this product for 3 years
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;This product is awesome. I originally bought it about a year ago to help tame my frizz when I curl my hair. It works pretty good for that. I do find that it weakens the curls though. What I found that this product works amazing for us healing split ends! I put this on the ends of my hair every night and brush through it. I've been doing that for about 2 months and my hair dresser said that she's never seen my hair so healthy!! Try this product it's amazing!!!
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;Excellent!
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I love this hair product.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;Got this because my hair was super dry after putting some blonde in it and it literally did everything I needed it to do. My hair is SO soft now. And also I would like to add I have very oily hair and most oils make my hair super greasy but this didn't do that. I don't spray it near my roots though.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I use this after styling to give my hair some protection and moisture.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I used this product after blowing out my hair, and then put my hair in a French braid. In the morning when I took the braid out my hair smelled like mildew, I completely dried my hair before I used it so I know it wasn't just from my hair still being wet.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;Love this product! I have very thick&frizzy hair and this helped tame away the frizz and made my hair feel very soft. I use it after I blow dry or straighten my hair. I also sometimes spray it on the ends of my hair when they need some extra moisture. It also smells amazing!
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;This is amazing as a leave in conditioner, doesn't make my hair greasy at all. I've used this for years. Get it if you have dry hair or split ends.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I love how this smells!! It makes my hair smell like it just came from the salon. It's a good product if you shower in the morning because it keeps my hair soft all day but by the next day my hair is flat and dry.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I love how it smoothens my skin at the end of the day it really is smooth I love that feeling I just can't stand the smell of this thing, it's smells weird for me and also after atleast 18hrs of wearing it it leaves a heavy amount of grease in my hair that's why I had to immediately shower ew
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I used to use this a few years ago and I remember liking it, but when I tried using it now it was awful. It made my hair both dry and greasy somehow....like lots of frizz but weighed down with a greasy look. Maybe it's better if you blow dry your hair? Had to return.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;definitely made a huge difference to my hair. I use it after I shower and/or straighten my hair. it leaves my hair feeling so silky. a little bit goes a long way
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I sprayed around 7 pumps to only the ENDS of my hair because that is where my hair is most frizzy. Worked WONDERS!! I did use the olapex shampoo and conditioner while in the shower, but this product was really able to cut out the frizz and leave my hair shiny and soft. I've dyed it around three times in the past year, once with bleach, and this product knocked the frizz out.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I put it on my freshly shampooed hair for styling. Leaves my hair sleek and shiny.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;Product is best on market
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I love this stuff! My hair is thin and also damaged from getting highlights. It helps bring moisture back to my hair! The thing that I hate about it though, is I have VERY sensitive acne prone skin and this stuff makes me break out! Still trying to decide if it's worth continuing to use. :-/
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I have been looking for my holy grail leave-in product for my thin hair for so long and I finally found it! It is SO lightweight, doesn't weigh the hair down, and makes it super shiny and soft. My hair has never looked better and since it's oil-based it helps keep out tangles too. This is great for right out of the shower and also for touching up between washes. I always had to wash my hair every 2nd day because my ends were too dry, and this works amazing for helping to treat your ends so you don't have to wash and condition it. All around amazing multi-use product and I'll keep buying it again and again!
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;My holy grail. I'll put this on when my hair is damp. After I brush, I'll separate my hair into two. A little goes a long way. It's very moisturizing and doesn't way my hair down. The best part about it is that it brings out my natural waves PERFECTLY. Almost looks like I have heat styled waves. It was always a struggle to bring out my natural waves without product as it would always frizz up. Not this product. Get it! You won't regret it!
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I have thick coarse Hispanic hair, this stuff is a god send but you really only need a small amount. It instantly made my frizz vanish without leaving it greasy or sticking together. Super excited I took a risk with this and for the price it really is amazing.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;This oil makes my hair smell good and very soft
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;moisturizes my 3c curls so so well. it feels super duper nice and I love it!
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;This is my must have product in my bathroom cabinet. My hair is always so dry no matter what products I use, but this oil has saved me so many times! It adds shine and tames frizz without making my hair oily. I spray on my ends and avoid my scalp. If you have any sort of dry or textured hair, this product is for you!
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;this works a little better when my hair is straightened, but it makes my curls lose their definition and feel like straw
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;After reading so many glowing reviews and enjoying another oil by OGX (the biotin one) I decided to give this a try! A few uses in, and I'm disappointed and unimpressed.  The first time I used it, I used about a quarter about, like I would with the biotin oil.  Nope.  My hair ended up so greasy!  For the next few washes, I reduced my amount DRASTICALLY and blow dried my hair, still heavy, sticky, and greasy.  I have medium density hair (not too think, not too fine) so I'm shocked at how much this weighs my hair down.  It also doesn't have any scent, the other oil smelled AMAZING! Did I just get a defective bottle?
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I love the OGX Moroccan oil.  It makes my hair super soft and it smells amazing.  I have naturally fine hair that has some damage from frequent coloring, and a very small amount of this on gently toweled hair after a shower has done amazing things for it.  If you have fine hair I will say it's easy to accidentally use too much, you really need about the size of a pea for shoulder length hair, and if your hair also trends oils at the roots like mine, only apply it to the bottom half of your hair, focusing on the roots.  This also had the side effect of making my hands really soft.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;makes my hair smooth/shiny and really tames frizziness on my hair ! Very lightweight and smells great :)
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I put this on my hair immediately after I shower with other products and I love it.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;i personally love this product. i have very dry and damaged hair and this always leaves it silky and smooth. i put it on after the shower and before i do my hair i also put hair spray in there but this gives it more of a silky finish.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;Moisturizes my hair so well and it makes It so so soft. Very happy with this.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;Both my daughter and I have really frizzy, curly hair. This works great to manage our curls and helps to detangle it as well.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;this oil has been moisturizing and adding shine to my hair all day! I use it after blow drying and apply all over my hair, I love the smell and the frizz control I cant get over it. ogx infused with argan oil of morocco leaving my hair shiny and glowing, no more frizz ! healing dry oil. beeauty pure and simple. Must try.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I love this stuff so much. I think I've bought it like 4 times now! It smells fantastic, it makes my hair so soft and it is way easier to comb through when its wet, and also once it dries. I have pretty fine (and very damaged...whoops) hair that isn't very thick, and it doesn't weigh it down at all. I use about a dime size and rub it on my hands and work in, starting at the bottom. It's great, I can't say that enough.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;Love this product
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;So I never used to use oil because it normally wears my curls down. But this oil! I spray it multiple times day. Makes it shiny & keeps my scalp from being dry. love love love.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;Makes hair more manageable
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;My hair looks/feels soft and healthy.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I usually use this product after I shower it works great on my hair
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;Its great everytime i use it
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;Thank you!
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I love this oil! It makes my hair so shiny and soft without being greasy or oily.  I just dyed my hair and everyone complimented how shiny it was.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I was amazed on how amazing my hair turned out! I absolutely loved! i added it to my hair before blow drying and after! my ends would always come out dry but this made it silky smooth!
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;It did help with my bleaching my hair and I am sooo happy with it.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;Makes your hair soft and glossy.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;After I work out and shower.  I use it on my hair and it works perfectly.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I was worried this would be too heavy for my thin short hair but it wasn't :) I obviously use a very small portion but this stuff is awesome! Cuts down drying time and leaves my hair super soft and shiney :) I love this way more than the CHi oil.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I am growing out some old color, so the bottom third of my shoulder length hair is pretty parched. I've used the OGX Coconut Oil mist after I'm finished styling with pretty good results.  I decided to try this for a change, and I am so glad I did!  After reading some of the reviews here, I decided to try spraying this on my hair when it's wet to see how it would do.  I cannot believe how smooth it made my hair when I blew it dry!  I don't straighten my naturally wavy hair every day, but my hair just glided through my iron this morning.  I was so impressed, I felt compelled to write a review.  I still sprayed a bit in my hands and ran them through my hair when I was finished styling, like I did with the coconut oil, and it left my hair feeling silky and healthy all day.  I absolutely love this stuff!  Highly recommend.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I have really dry hair and this helped a lot with that, my hair looks less dull, it looks more healthy and it smells amazing!
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;Spray into hand and run threw hair or spray a few times a few inches away from ended. Personally helped me with moisture after showers for a fix for my split ends.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;Love this. Smells sooooo good and leaves my hair feeling so soft when I wake up. I put this on after I've showered and brushed my hair.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;It smells amazing! The mist is so fine, it's light weight, not greasy and it gives beautiful shine. I love this!
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I spray this on my hair every night before bed and then before I leave for work.  It has completely changed how my hair feels and looks.  I have pain-in-the-butt curly hair thats been through just about every treatment imaginable and dyed (because blondes have more fun right?).  This product has completely changed my life.  I do go through it extremely fast, but its relatively cheap so I don't care!!!
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I like the product it smells good and is very light on my hair.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I've been using this for years now. Love it. Seems a little oily when you first put it on, but my hair absorbs it and it gives me softness and shine. I also like the smell.Works great., better than higher priced products.I'm always afraid they will discontinue it.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I asked a question on here about it being shiny enough. I bought it and whoa was it shiny! Love it! I use it almost everyday cause my hair is so thick. The only problem is it's only shiny in the sunshine and never indoors. Thinking about getting the shampoo and conditioner. Maybe that will help.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;Spritz on when using heat and it leaves hair smooth soft and shiny! What a bargain too! Smells great!
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;Argan oil really does help maintain my hair. My hair is overprocessed therefore there's only so much it can do which is calm down frizz and coat my hair to keep it from looking like a broom. But I notice my hair turns yellow much quicker and after reading the ingredients listed in the bottle(which are not listed in this website) that it contains red and yellow dyes..
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I have natural curly hair. I don't wash my hair everyday but I wet it everyday. I've been having trouble finding something that can define my curls while keeping them baby soft. This product does that for me.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;It doesn't weight my hair down and pleasant smell.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I seen this once on Pinterest for dry brittle hair. So I purchased once & OMG now this like my 4 bottle or so. I use this once I step out the shower then blow dry or air dry May hair. Smells super good!! I spray once I straighten my hair too. I also use it the next day once I brush my hair. Hubby loves the smell too
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;Just spray it in your hair regularly and you should feel your hair feel softer and livelier. I just spray it on my ends.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;Affordable and actually softens texture of colored hair!
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I always put it on my wet hair then blow dry. Just in case I put too much on the blow drying helps dry it out a little more. I also put it on my dry hair to try to smooth out the frizziness. You do need to be careful because you can put to much on and look like you have dirty oily hair.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;this products sucks. messed up my hair, drying it terribly. WORST product ever
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I have dry hair because I dye it.  I use this almost nightly.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;like it very much
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;Tamed frizz and smells amazing 🙌 doesn't leave a greasy residue
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;i use this product every day and it does a great job keeping my hair from getting frizzy. it works much better than other moroccan/argan oil products that i have used in the past. my only issue with it is that it's difficult to dispense the product without getting too much or dripping it all over the side of the bottle
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;Works great
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;Makes my hair feel good and healthy. I use it on damp hair and I love it. Good price too.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;Awesome! Lightweight oil! Superior!
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;This is a very lightweight oil and it smells nice.  Not a heavy scent.  I spray a small amount in the palm of my hand and apply it to the ends of my hair.  Does a very nice job.  I ran out of my Moroccan Miricle Oil and was looking for something to use and this works great.  Would definetely recommend.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I love how weightless this product really is. I have thick wavy hair and any product can weigh it down even more. This adds shine, helps with the dryness, smells great, and gives shine without it looking greasy.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I've been spending tons of money on products for my daughter's curly, tangly, sometimes matted, frizzy, dry hair. It's been a nightmare, nothing works well at all. My friend and I were at Ulta and she recommended this. So, it wasn't a wash day for my daughter so I divided her hair into 3 sections, misted with water and sprayed this and then using a WIDE comb, I combed it through. WOW, incredible results. She then went to bed and I expcted to have to fight it again this morning but low and behold it was hardly tangled at all, just a bit at the ends. Another misting of water and this and it was perfect again.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;Makes my hair soft and smells really good!
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;Man I was excited to try this only to find out it has drying ingredients such an trimthone an dimethicone smh
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I have wavy/curly hair and it took me years to find the right product for this humid Florida weather. Glad I chose to buy this product on a whim. It's not greasy on my hair and it smells good too! I usually spray it on my towel-dried hair after shower and my hair is ready in the morning.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I have crazy curly dry hair and this argan oil helps a lot.     I use it daily.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I bought this purely to add moisture to my hair on occasion. Not knowing if it would make my hair greasy, I decided to use it after my hair was towel dried and discovered that it made my hair dry so quickly! It's better than my Redken Pillow Proof Primer Spray and the Redken Diamond Oil Spray for a cheaper price. I can spray quite a bit onto my hair and it won't look greasy, so this product is a win.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I put it in my hair after almost every shower, my hair gets really tangly so this helps smooth it out and makes it feel a lot softer and smoother!!
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;One of my all time favorite hair products!!
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I use this on my hair twice a week
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I love using this product every day.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;leaves hair shiny and healthy looking! weightless. not greasy.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I love it. For my curls. They shine and stay moisturized throughout the day. Not looking dry
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I used to always think that hair products needed an expensive price tag in order to actually be good, but that's definitely not the case with this product. I have thick, frizzy, and chemically processed hair, and I use this oil every time I wash my hair. I apply it when my hair is still wet and whether I decided to let my hair air dry or I blow dry it, this oil has done so much to keep my hair looking and feeling good!
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;"I was having a problem with ""static electricity"" and could not get it controlled.  this product did the trick.  Love it.  My husband also uses it every morning, he is balding and his ""scalp""is dry.  This product works!"
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I am disappointed in this product. I thought it would be a lot more effective and helpful to my damaged and dry hair. It isn't really doing much for me except leaving my hair looking and feeling greasy. The smell is great but i would not recommend this product for trying to restore your hair and get it healthy again. I just don't see it working.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I love this hair oil! I use it on wet hair before I blow dry it and it works better than Living Proof. I also spray a little on my finished hairstyle and it makes my hair soft and smooth. It repaired the damage I had from using Big Sexy Flat Iron Spray. This is amazing and I will continue to buy it again and again!!!
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;i use this oil 1-2x a week, it helps keep my hair soft & smooth. i particularly like to use this after using a clarifying shampoo
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;Made my hair shiny but not oily, tamed frizz, smoothed dead ends and smells great! Buying again as I'm almost out of my bottle :)
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;This is hands down the best product I've used on my hair in a very long time.  It makes your hair feel so soft, look soft and not frizzy at all.  I flat iron my hair every day and it makes it look awesome!!
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I just wash and go, this oil made my hair less frizzy
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;the best!!!!!
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;Are use it after I wash my hair while it's still wet
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;Perfect if you have coarse horse hair like mine. It softens and makes hair more manageable
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;I have a pixie cut I used to bleach platinum myself (my hair is actually in really good condition), but the very back is ruined from the bleaching without help. Currently growing out my pixie for the second time and this helps make me frizzy straw like ends lay flat and feel smooth. Been using for three months now, def recommend. Only wish it fixed my hair rather than covered it.
Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil;Essential to smooth and detangle damaged frizzy blonde hair. I use about a tablespoonful on wet hair before I brush and blowdry.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I have been using this product for a few months & have lost so much hair since I have been using. I did not think it was related to the product until I did some research.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I've been using this product for several months, and it left my hair in worse condition than before.  It's way too soft -- and fly-away!  None of which is an improvement over no conditioner at all.  The only good thing I experienced with this product is the fragrance -- if it was a product that did even the minimum of what any conditioner should do, I would buy it just for the fragrance.  Too bad, because I love other OGX products.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;It'll make your hair feel full and give volume, but at the same time it'll weigh it down. Your hair will become oily, and be due for a wash compared to normal time.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I bought this shampoo hoping I could achieve more thick and voluminous hair. However, after using this product only 2 times it left a waxy/sticky coat over my hair and actually made me loose hair. I have never used a product that made me loose so much hair especially if it claims to strengthen your hair
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;As a conditioner
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;i am so disappointed that a product I have used forever has changed. I noticed no difference in shampoo. But this new formula for the conditioner is just sad. totally dries out hair as if theres no conditioner in it at all. My first clue was it was not squeezing out of the bottle right. It actually tangles my hair leaving it hard now and not soft and easy to get a wide tooth comb through this thin hair. I am so disappointed and am going to have to change brands. I pulled out a sample bottle and then this. The ingredient's are switched around and some changed. I am going to have to throw away a bottle 3/4 full. I used so much last night to try to make it work and its still horrid.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Not sure if this is a bad bottle, but I have a heck of a time getting product out of container, and when I do, its just a blob and it doesn't lather up.  Not to impressed at this point.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I was surprised I liked this shampoo and conditioner so much. I think the people who didn't like it probably were using it every time they washed their hair. I alternate with a higher quality shampoo and conditioner (lanza and a purple shampoo) and I've never had a problem with build up. Im obsessed with the smell! I can go to bed with my hair wet and just brush it in the morning and it looks like I just had a blow out.  Is this the best shampoo and conditioner for the health of your hair? Probably not.. but its a good one to have in the shower for the days you want something different.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Smells absolutely awful, would NOT recommend!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;"This is the strangest shampoo (and the conditioner) to me. I am used to shampoos that feel frothy and rich, and conditioners that feel silky when I rinse them out. I do a lot of detangling with my fingers in the shower because my hair is so long. It's well past my waist, almost to the top of my legs. Finger detangling in the shower helps prevent a lot of breakage. This shampoo (and the conditioner) scared me at first. I could hardly get my fingers through my hair. It knotted up when I shampooed, and took forever to get the knots out. The shampoo seemed to completely strip my hair, or so it felt. I'm talking SQUEEEEEAKY clean. I assumed that when it dried, it would look like a broom. But it didn't. I also used the conditioner, which didn't give me a warm fuzzy feeling, either. I didn't use any detangler or hair oil out of the shower because I wanted to see exactly how this stuff worked for me. I carefully detangled with a flat detangling brush and let it air dry. And it looked amazing! I was shocked. My hair was so shiny and soft. It had lots of movement, and my waves had definition. I've used about half of both bottles so far, and I'm not seeing any change. My hair doesn't seem to be drying out or breaking, and I haven't noticed any unusual hair fall. I'm still on the fence, though, because it's so difficult to detangle. The ""after"" is great for me. It's getting there that's difficult, and I don't like spending ages on my hair. I want to wash, detangle, and let it air dry on its own."
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Great product!! Loved it! Give a heavy hair look. happy with purchase.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I recently cut my waist-length hair off to about my jawline, and was seriously concerned about volume. My hair has always been super thin, so when I chopped it off, I was instantly on the hunt for a good voluming shampoo. I work at Ulta and despite my employee discount, I'm not a fan of dropping a ton of money on shampoos because I like to mix mine to get various benefits. OGX has worked great for me in the past and I love that it's cruelty free and very affordable. While this shampoo in particular doesn't smell the ~best~ it works AMAZING. My hair has gotten some SERIOUS volume since I've started using it and I've found myself using less volumizing styling products just because I don't want my hair to look poofy! Can't say I've had to deal with that before! Overall, I totally recommend and will plan on getting this again once I run out!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;So far I love it
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This made my hair feel dry and as if there was a coat of sticky wax covering it - will not be buying again
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I have used several different kinds of shampoo and this one made my thin post postpartum hair thick and healthy
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;After trying this product for two months, I'm going tomorrow to get my long hair cut off at my neck because it feels like straw, is breaking, and falling out.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I read the other reviews about the DMDM in this that causes hair loss. After using this shampoo my hair falls out, is dry and brittle. Looking at the ingredients on Ulta's website, the DMDM is not listed. On the bottle in my shower it's listed plain as day!! Why didn't ulta include it on their ingredients?! That's shady.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This shampoo knotted my hair up so bad, and I experienced so much hair loss. Honestly while I was using it I never thought anything of it until i seen that other people were experiencing the same issue, it also dried out my hair. Never will purchase this again!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;The best product ever if you have damaged hair
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I've been using this for about 2 years, thinking it was good for my hair. WRONG! It has DMDM Hydantoin as well as other ingredients that DAMAGE your hair and cause HAIR LOSS! As a 27-yr old experiencing hair loss, this is not okay!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I decided to try this after reading an article rating shampoos for thin hair, (this was the reasonably priced option) and boy I'm sure glad I did! My very fine, very thin hair seems thicker and fuller after only about a week of daily washing! It also does not seem to be drying like other shampoos I've tried. I was very skeptical, but this has certainly lived up to it's recommendation. I definitely recommend it.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Unfortunately I used this for years since it's sulfate and paraben free. However it has DMDM hydantoin!!! This is no better than using tresemme. Look up the lawsuits and save your hair. I switched to hempz shampoo and conditioner
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;My husband used this product, and his scalp was very irritated.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I started noticing hair loss after a few times using this shampoo and conditioner. At the time I didnt think none of it until my shower got clogged. When I unclogged it and seen the amount of hair I lost I wanted to cry. I immediately threw the product away and stopped using it. I then googled what causes hair loss and seen that this product contains DMDM hydantoin and sodium chloride. Which both ingredients are bad for your scalp & causes hair loss.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I used it for 3 times now. It's really good shampoo. The only negative thing - the smell is too strong.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I can't honestly rate this for how it works but I will tell you if you don't like that fake coconut smell that smells like a car air freshener, you will hate this smell.  It's just like it.  Must return.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;After using the shampoo and conditioner for only one week, my hair has so much volume and looks healthy!  I am not losing hair as I was before.  So impressed with this product!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This product smells great and leaves my hair soft
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I've been using this shampoo for a few weeks now, because I wanted my hair to feel thicker and more voluminous. The first few times I used it, I thought my hair looked super shiny and clean. As I've continued to use it, I've noticed a drastic REDUCTION in my hair's volume. My hair is so limp and feels incredibly thin now. The shampoo smells good and it does make my hair shiny, but it is not worth all the fall out!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;So I tried switching to different shampoos and conditioners to see differences, and I always go back to this!! The only shampoo and conditioner that leaves my hair so soft and healthy feeling. My hair grew the longest when I used this. Will always stick with it!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Seriously like food for my hair!! Thankful & please do not change formula or do anything with this product! Life changing!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I purchased this after seeing thousands of great reviews of several sites. I question if the reviews are legit because this stuff is terrible! The shampoo along with the conditioner will dry out your hair! My hair was so dry, coarse and difficult to straighten with a straightener after using this. Usually after shampooing and conditioning, your hair immediately becomes softer and you can run your fingers through it. I couldn't run my fingers through my hair at all in the shower with the conditioner that goes along with this shampoo. The texture / fragrance of this stuff reminds me of something you'd find at a cheap discount store. It is not worth the price. I am throwing both bottles out and purchasing new ones because it is ruining my hair!!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Dried my hair out severely and made it start falling out! I've always been super self conscious of my thin hair and now it's worse than before. So disappointed.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I wash my hair twice a week while it stays full and soft and  feeling good with how my hair feels.  With what I was using left a coating and flats on my hair and I lost more hair.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;"I honestly am torn between liking and disliking this product. The shampoo and conditioner does what it's labeled to do, my hair is noticeable thicker and has more texture. However, it's almost thick to the point where it has lost all natural shape and bounce and just wants to poof out like a box around my head. It's almost crunchy. On top of that, the product leaves a waxy film on your hair and on your skin that is impossible to rinse out completely. I guess that's what makes your hair feel ""thicker""? It smells really strong too, like reallyyyy strong. I like the smell because it reminds me of warm vanilla sugar, but sensitive users beware. Like I said, does the job, but due to its quirks I will not be repurchasing."
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I bought this shampoo and conditioner desperately looking for something to help me with my rapidly thinning hair.  My hair has gotten so thin that I can see my scalp throughout it so I was hoping to find a product to help add volume.  At first the product was really helping my hair look great, and then I started to notice a film being left on my scalp after showering no matter how well I rinsed my hair.  This film made my hair feel grimy and my scalp was itchy....so the search for a perfect shampoo and conditioner continues.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Where has this been my whole life!!! It smells amazing, my hair feels so much thicker, shinier, so soft and not frizzy at all. I love love love this formula.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Smells nice but made my hair feel incredibly dry. I have tried other organix products and loved them but the collagen ones just dry out my hair for some reason.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;i was a little sceptical about trying it because of all the bad reviews but i figured hey why not my hair was already falling out ALOT and i mean literal bunches of hair i was so depressed about it and decided to give it a try let me tell you i was so happy to see only a couple hairs go down the drain after i showered i also noticed it helped with the itching on my scalp i was so sick of using head and shoulders it made my hair stink! this one smells sweet like vanilla :) the only bad thing is it does make your hair dry so i use the ogx coconut serum for that  , other than that i love how full my hair feels now and also how much it stopped falling out
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I used this shampoo religiously for two or three years now. I loved the smell and it gave good softness and volume to my thin, fine hair. I recently noticed more and more of my hair falling out in the shower and began to fear the worst, like a hormone issue, until I happened to read a review for this shampoo and everyone else was mentioning hair loss. Put it in the trash immediately and moved on to a new brand and the hair loss is slowly stopping but it's going to be a long journey to get it back to normal.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This shampoo turned into gel after two weeks! It's super sticky now and can't be washed out of my hair. It was even hard to get off of my hands. The first few uses were good but i had to throw it away after only a few weeks
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I was using this shampoo and conditioner for a while because I have fine hair, and lack of volume, so it seemed like a great solution! I started using it for a few months and noticed the hair appeared to be thicker, and slightly more voluminous. However, shortly after, I got my hair colored and bought some salon quality shampoo and conditioner to protect the color and used that. Flash Forward, the salon hair product is gone and I switch back to this product. I didn't think anything of it at first, I noticed my hair didn't feel as soft but wasn't too bothered by it. A few days of using it and I'm noticing my hair will not stop getting greasy by the end of the day! With the salon product I could easily go two maybe three days without washing, with this product I can barely go one. It's irritating for me because I'm not sweating profusely or working out in any way. The only difference is this shampoo/conditioner. Also I've notice it's difficult to run my fingers through my hair, as well as to brush it, And I definitely have an increase of tangles and knots. Like others have mentioned, it must be product build up in the hair. The other let down is the  conditioner formula is really thin and barely feels like it moisturizes my hair at all, somehow it feels more stripped of moisture after using it in the shower. honestly had it not been for my Salon product experience I might not have never noticed but I'm glad I did!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;"Have used for a long time. Definitely helps hair look and feel more full. Not a new formula. There was an additional Biotin kind that OGX launched called ""Extra Strength"" or something, but this Thick and Full Biotin one looks to still be the same."
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I have thick wavy hair that is naturally very soft and manageable. This shampoo and conditioner made it impossible to brush through or do anything with, and it left a sticky residue. My hair was very dry but greasy at the roots, and my hair feels a lot thinner than when I started using it.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Got this because it seemed to have good ingredients. Biotin, collagen, vitamins, etc. Is sold as sulfate free but the third ingredient is a sulfate. I use this product like I've used others and after using this my scalp is always itching, I'm starting to get flakes, and normally I wash my hair 2 times a week but since using this, I can't be the day after washing my hair is insanely oily. Idk what the issue is with this company and their products but I've had the same problem when I used their keratin shampoo a few years ago.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This left a heavy film on my hair that made it feel nasty and unmanageable. My hair started falling out because of this. I threw this and the shampoo in the trash.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This shampoo and conditioner stripped my hair.  My hair is naturally dry, anyway, and it took 3 months to restore it (let is grow out). I keep my hair short.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I couldn't figure out why my hair felt so terrible the past few weeks. Usually, it is smooth and doesnt take much to detangle. I thought there was something wrong with me, until I realized I had recently started using this conditioner. I threw it out, used a Wella conditioner last night instead, and my hair is back to normal, although now I have breakage  due to how much I had to comb through knots in my hair because of this conditioner. Skip this one people, save your hair
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Used the OGX Thick and Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo for YEARS, and it made a huge difference to improve the thickness of my hair. But the ingredients are now different, and... just no. Not the same. In the history of cosmetics and hair products, I've only ever encountered 2 products that were truly improved when the ingredients changed. This was not one of those 2 products. I'm not looking forward to the annoyance of finding a new shampoo.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;i like that this shampoo is sulfate free, i don't think it did anything for thickness, and the fragrance is a bit too strong but smells nice
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Love the smell, love the feel afterwards, less frizzy and easier to manage. LOVE THIS!!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Replay I feel different when only one use
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Please use caution with this shampoo. I had used OGX brand products in the past (Argan Oil), and never had issues. However, about a week into using this shampoo and conditioner I noticed a large amount of hair fall and actually noticed several completely bald spots on my head. It made my hair extremely dry, tangled, and unmanageable. I know some people love it and have no issues, but I really wish I would have read more reviews before using. I'm now devastated and trying to grow my hair back.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I was excited to try this da shampoo and conditioner because I have had good experiences with other products from this brand, however I am not impressed with this one. It made my hair feel very waxy/greasy and dried my ends out quite a bit. I have fine hair strands, but thick hair overall. It weighed my hair down rather than adding volume. Might work for other hair types but not mine particularly.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Ever since I discovered this product shampoo and conditioner in my local supermarket, that's all I ever use now. I leave a tad bit conditioner in my hair for manageability after I wash my hair. My hair is so soft and full looking. I've gotten many compliments how healthy my hair looks. Great Product !! Thanks
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This conditioner is very thin and has barely any slip which made detangling my curly hair very hard, I gave it two stars because it did make my hair grow faster because of the biotin but it is very drying, as soon as I step out of the shower my hair feels silicone-e and it definitely made my hair frizzier.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This product is literally the best. My hair started falling a lot and I'm only 22 and I had no idea why. I started investing in all these hair shampoos for thinning hair like purador and Moroccan oil shampoo but they all made my hair fall in clumps. There was so much hair in the drain. My friend told me to buy the ogx biotin shampoo and conditioner and let me tell you, the results were amazing! After one use there was literally 2 strands of hair in the drain when I was done. And the best thing is you only need a drop. A little goes a long way. It definitely helped my itchy dry scalp and I can feel my hair getting thicker. YOU GUYS MUST TRY!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Beware- this will make your hair fall out in CLUMPS in the shower. Will never use again!!!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I swear by OGX conditioner. Even when I treat my hair with heat every day, this helps keep the split ends away. It's always surprising to my hair stylist how I have almost no split ends.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I used Nioxin for about 3 months. I did get compliments about my hair looking thicker but it left my hair extremely dry and frizzy. The first day after using this, I received the same compliments but also was told my hair looked healthier! Definitely using this instead, plus I'm saving a lot of money!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Looking for a new shampoo. Not much better than what I used already.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Was recommended by a friend but doesn't work for me. Needed to use another product to get the tangles out and moisturize
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I see a lot of people asking about what kind of scent this is all the time, and it states that it is a floral. Could be true, but I would compare it smelling to Aquolina pink sugar perfume, or sugar Scentsy bar. One of the reasons I use this shampoo, is for the awesome scent!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Not recommended for curly/course hair
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I wanted to give this product a try because I was loosing hair by the hand fulls and my hair is getting very thin. After just the first few uses I notice no lose of hair my hair was smooth and soft. The more I use it I'm noticing it getting frizzy but only loose a few strands vs a ton. I will continue to use this shampoo and conditioner.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I used this multiple times & was never able to fully wash it out ever. It leaves my hair with a waxy residue that makes it impossible to run my fingers through or brush easily. It is therefore prone to tangling and breaking. I normally have fine, smooth, and somewhat slippery hair & while this product gave the appearance of volume, it was simply product buildup making the strands appear thicker. Would not recommend, I am throwing out the remaining product.

Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Been buying this shampoo since summer. Keeps your hair full & moisturized. Smells great!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I have damaged hair due to bleaching it over 8yrs. I recently went brunette. I've been looking for a shampoo to help with my hair. My hair is damaged and feels frizzy and dry. After reading the reviews on here, I wanted to give it a try. Let me tell youC best thing ever! My hair was soft after getting out of the shower. I didn't even struggle to brush my hair. I totally recommend it if you have damaged hair. If it doesn't work out for you, you can always return it.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I use this shampoo every day.  It is the best I have used as far as keeping my hair stronger and healthier
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;And i used to use it a lot. But yeah if you just want your hair to smell delicious buy it.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I've received comments and noticed the thickness and shine
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;"Honestly, I had high hopes for this shampoo.  After using it, I noticed my head itching.  Then I started to feel bumps.  At first I thought ""maybe it's something else"", so I tried a different shampoo for a few days.  My scalp got better.  Went back to this shampoo/conditioner and the bumps are back and my head itches."
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;"""Dimethicone (which is in this product) is used as a sealant against water and even air. It is not a natural ingredient, and its side effects are bad for our hair. It gives the hair the illusion of shine, but it is not the shine we want—it is a fake shine from the plastic."" DO NOT BUY!"
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;my hair has grown so much since i started using this shampoo in the summer. 10 times out of 10 if my friends haven't seen me in two weeks they always comment on how my hair has gotten even longer since they've seen me! but also note my hair is healthy and i have rarely used heat in about a year. so not sure the effects on damaged hair
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I wash my hair 2-3 a week.  The crown of my head has noticeable breakage and this shampoo is helping alleviate that.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This hasn't really done anything for my hair. It's fine as a conditioner, but I dont think it's a great choice if you're trying to repair damage.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;My hair was falling in bulk really bad and I read this shampoo was good so I decided to give it a try and iam really happy with the results. I had 2 bald spots on my head and hair is starting to grow back again...
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I tried out the shampoo and conditioner as my sister had just bought it and the reviews seemed very promising but this DRIED MY HAIR OUT SO BAD! My hair has never felt or looked more dehydrated and frizzy. I will say they both smelled very nice and felt hydrating while I had used them in the shower but I did not like the way my hair dried at all. Very disappointed.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I want to love this shampoo simply because of the smell, but everytime i wash, it leaves my hair dull and greasy. I thought maybe it was just when I blow dried, but even after letting it air dry, it looked terrible. It always feels like the stuff isn't fully washed out every.single.time. It's so frustrating!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This is literally the worst conditioner I've ever used. It leaves so much build up on my hair, it makes me cringe. It feels like I didn't wash the conditioner out, and I stood in the shower EXTRA to make sure I got it all out. The reason people think that this gives them volume is because it just leaves build up on your hair! Avoid this product like the plague.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I used this in conjunction with the shampoo. I found that my hair looks thicker and fuller. conditioner makes my hair feel very soft and helps with tangles.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Does what it says. Leaves hair looking fuller and thicker.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Light weight and takes a small amount to use. Make my hair softer and easier to comb after washing my hair.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Inexpensive and works great
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;After just 3 to 4 washes I can tell the difference. I've used biometrix full density and OGX works 10x better
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;These shampoo and conditions are the best.  Safe for color treated and keratin treated hair.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Smells great! Leaves my hair soft & manageable.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I have two large drawerfuls of shampoo and conditioner. I'm always on the hunt for a shampoo that will tame my frizzy hair but not make it flat. This shampoo not only leaves my hair looking healthy but leaves my hair looking full and thick
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I have naturally straight, thin, fine hair and I have been using this shampoo for about a week now and my hair definitely feels fuller and thicker. I personally alternate every other wash using a normal shampoo because I don't want my hair to become too full and thick. Highly recommend for those with thin hair!!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Literally the best shampoo ever! I was experiencing serious fall outs, horrible! Was looking for a good shampoo and saw this on the shelf at Ulta. I have tried really expensive ones and never got the result I was looking for- promises of soft, shiny and etc. never happened with other ones. This biotin shampoo and conditioner not only leaves my hair sooo soft - living in humid Texas- but also has reduced the fall outs drastically. By drastically I mean if I was loosing 100 hair a day now it is like 10 a day. I hope it stays the same for my hair and scalp. I ordered two more of the big ones. Thanks for the great product. Hope it helps other people. Btw my hair is colored and my husband is also enjoying this shampoo and conditioner.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I have thin hair, and I love using the shampoo/conditioner combo because it leaves my hair looking thick.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Love the smell of this shampoo. Leaves my hair looking beautiful.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I really like this shampoo/conditioner combo. Great smell, keeps my hair tamed and voluminous. I am a biolage fiend but I couldnt justify the price for them anymore. For jumbo sizes OGX is affordable for my budget and even better durring the Jumbo Shampoo & Conditioner sale. I like using this and then blowdrying my hair after with their OGX thermal protector silk blowout cream.

Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Smells like literal heaven. I cannot stop smelling it. BUT after i wash my hair with it, i can't smell it on my hair hours later like i can with other shampoos which makes me sad.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I love this   Conditioner  It works so well it's great for fine hair
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I have tried matrix, kenra, and redken. You wont find anything else that will give you more volume than this one.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;The shampoo made my hair really soft, but the conditioner dried it out. Honestly used this and the shampoo for at least 2 or 3 months and saw no change in my hair.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I noticed a big difference with my hair after about 3 weeks of use.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I mixed this conditioner with olaplex and L'Oréal professional deep conditioner and I love the way my hair feels. My hair stylist even noticed my hair has been growing out. Definitely saw a change in hair growth more than I did with the biotin vitamins I was taking
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This shampoo (and the matching conditioner) do make my hair feel soft, and the smell is great. But after 3 months of scalp acne I've decided that I need to change to something else. I've never had that problem before, and didn't even know that it could be a problem until now.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I have long fine color treated hair. After using the conditioner for a couple weeks I noticed my hair in my brush about 2x the regular amount and every time I ran my hand through my hair, I would have 5-10 strands in my hand multiple times. DO NOT BUY THIS if you want to keep your hair. I did like how my hair felt silky and felt light but it's totally not worth it haha.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Ever since Ive been using this product people have been asking me if I got hair extensions. It makes my hair look soo full. I use it with the marula oil conditioner - great combination as it keeps my ends hydrated. I also have a sensitive scalp in which most shampoos cause flaking but this shampoo doesnt irritate. So thankful to have bought this. Originally bought in store but will now be purchasing online religously :D
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Have bought this product before....it's great for body
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;After 6 weeks of use, my hair is not thicker and I still have no volume. My hair is smooth, but I was looking for some volume.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I love this product! Definitely my new go to conditioner. I have not tried the shampoo yet, but after this I'm definitely going to!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Honestly i love it! i had really dry scalp and this helped so much i tried many shampoos and conditioners and none seemed to work for me except this one! It made my hair super silky soft!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I bought the shampoo and conditioner and LOVE THEM! I have fine, thinning hair. This really plumps up my hair, smells great, and doesn't leave my hair greasy after a few hours. Smells yummy too!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Almost seems like a miracle. My hair is gorgeous after one use. Soft, bouncy and full of life.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;good
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I bought this product in February after reading some good reviews. I wanted to grow my hair out and add volume to it. Though this product did help me grow my hair, it broke me out SO BAD the minute I started using it and no matter what I tried, the breakouts were too big and aggressive. I've finally decided to stop using it because the outcome is not worth it. I would not recommend this to anyone, as there are many other products that can help you grow your hair that won't break you out severely!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This shampoo does what it says and actually the first week I used it I got two compliments on how long and great my hair looked. However, it's  not worth the rash and scalp acne it caused. At first I thought I could manage a little hairline acne but now my scalp is completely irritated and my sideburns are full of acne. This has only happened to me once before (with Herbal Essences products) so I wouldn't say I have a sensitive scalp or anything, this is just really harsh I guess.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This and the matching conditioner get the job done. I've been using them for 3 months. However, I personally didn't notice any dramatic changes. I don't really see any extra volume or a thicker/fuller effect on my hair, like the shampoo claims. Overall, it is a nice shampoo but I won't repurchase.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Eh wouldn't buy it again.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I love this product. My braiding stylist used it once after I ran out of my normal conditioner and I've been hooked. That was about a year ago. I love the smell and the price. My hair is thick and kinky. I am a 4a/b hair texture. Yes, it detangles too and I am very tender headed so I am a fan!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Daughter's hair has never looked this good or been this easy to take care of
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This conditioner smells amazing. But that's about all the positive I have to say about this. It leaves residue in my hair and is causing some buildup. It's also super drying and causing my hair to be slightly unmanageable when trying to comb out afterwards. I will continue to use in small amounts along with a leave in conditioner that I now have to use to make my hair manageable but I will not repurchase.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This shampoo smells amazing. It lathers well and feels good in the shower. However, it doesn't do much for adding volume or thickness to my hair. And I think it's a bit drying. The matching conditioner doesn't do much for the dryness either. Will probably use until it's gone but won't repurchase.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This conditioner instantly gets out all tangles and knots in my curly hair no matter how many days old it is!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I purchased OGX because it came recommended by a hairstylist friend. I have somewhat oily, fine, wavy/straight hair. This shampoo/conditioner leaves my hair so dry and it feels like I didn't wash all of the product out every time. Not fan. Smells nice and the conditioned is nice and thick.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Great quality shampoo at a great price. Plus, it smells amazing!! My hair feels so clean after using this shampoo, yet it's gentle and doesn't dry my hair out. It actually feels stronger.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;gave this shampoo/conditioner a go but did not become a fan. It made my hair greasy by the second day, the smell was not pleasant and it made my hair fallout. i WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS SHAMPOO/CONDITIONER.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I have fine hair and volume/body is always a concern. I saw a noticeable difference within 2 uses! I love this shampoo!!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I gave this shampoo/conditioner combo a go, and I totally hate it! It leaves a thick, almost waxy feeling to my hair afterwards and it weighs it down so much. I thought maybe I was using too much product, so I used less, but even then it still left a very unpleasant feeling to my hair after my hair dries. Not to mention my hair looks like a grease ball by day 2! I won't be repurchasing.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I'm unsure if it's the shampoo, conditioner, or a combination of both, but this certain line of OGX leaves my hair with a waxy, weighed down feeling afterwards. I've tried using less product (thinking I was using too much) but even then it leaves a unpleasant feeling to my hair. Not a fan!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Every time I shampoo my hair
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I use this shampoo every other day with the matching conditioner and have told friends about it. I love the full thickness it gives my hair!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I love this shampoo (along with the matching conditioner). I noticed my hair was fuller after one use. Gives much better results than some expensive brands I've tried. Will buy again!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;We used this as our girls weekend out! And we all loved the smell and how it made our hair feel. We all have different types of hair.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;"This product is full of harmful sulfates that WILL dry your hair out. Depending on the individuals hair, they may notice right away (first use) or they may not notice until multiple or even several uses. But this WILL damage your hair. Having hair that ""APPEARS"" thicker is not worth the possibility of going bald. I mean the amount of reviewers with an experience of hair falling out is enough to make you not want to take the risk anyway. This shampoo did nothing for my hair back when I used it but make it extremely dry, brittle, itchy, tangled, etc. IF YOU WANT THICKER OR LONGER HAIR JUST TAKE ACTUAL BIOTIN VITAMINS. Try the rice water technique. Try using less heavy products. There are a ton of other ways that worked for me. This just wasn't one of them."
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This shampoo dried my hair out so much and didn't give me any volume at all. My hair has always been really dry and thick so maybe it would work better on thinner or oily hair.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;My hair was thinning out a lot and I was starting to get worried. I've been super stressed and also breastfed my daughter for a year. Immediately after using my hair felt, clean fuller and thicker. I was shocked! I also purchased conditioner. And would recommend using both. I used just shampoo one time without conditioner and it felt fluffy. I'm so happy I found this!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I have purchase this product and was excited to try it considering the great reviews I read, after the first wash it left my hair feeling silky, soft and smelling good. I even noticed the boost in volume. Shortly after less then 2 weeks of using this product my hair began to fall out in HUGE clumps and it left my hair greasy and dry and at the ends.. I would not recommend anyone buying this if you have dry or straight hair..
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I wash my hair every other day and the volume it gives is great
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Left my scalp dry and flaky and my hair oily
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This product (and even the brand) have been so hyped by people around me that I decided to try it this semester.  Upon reading some other comments here, I FINALLY figured out I'm not the only one struggling with this shampoo!  Before using this product, I had thick, wavy hair that I loved.  Sure I've changed lengths and cut my bangs 4 times here and there, but I've never dyed it and the texture has always been the same.  I've been using this shampoo consistently for 4 months waiting for my thick hair to come back.  I'm a nightshower-er, so I use this right before bed.  Twice a week, I've been conditioning with their coconut milk conditioner.  I've been waking up the morning after itching my head like I have a terrible case of lice (even though I have NO bugs in my head and don't see any dandruff), and I continue to feel the urge to itch it throughout the entire day.  My scalp has been ridiculously waxy and greasy all the time as well, and it's gotten to the point where dried shampoo can't even dry all that gunk out for a few hours while I'm in class or at work.  Plus, the whole bottom half of my locks are all dried up, so having my hair down closely resembles a wet rat.  I wear my hair up most of the time to cover it.  It feels so good to know I'm not alone, and I'll DEFINITELY be trying a new product ASAP.
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This shampoo lathers so well! My hair feels and smells super clean! And most importantly, my hair looks thicker and more healthy. I actually got lots of compliments on my hair after using it!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I have 3b thin hair and I bought this product excitedly hoping it would give my hair the fullness i've always wanted but instead my hair ended up falling out in clumps :( didn't give the product 1 star because it probably works better on straight hair despite saying it works on any hair type and it smells really really good
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Don't use this product daily because it will ruin your hair. It will cause it to thin out. I have naturally thick hair and I used this product and my hair was ruined after continual use. Just don't use this product at all— there is much better out there!
Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Before I went natural I used to straighten my hair 24/7 every day and it broke off a chunk of hair unfortunately but this stuff fixed that and grew out my hair and made it more thicker!! I am now natural (3b curl type) and I still use this product and it still works just as good!!
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;Read that causes cancer :/ other than that AMAZING. do more research about ogx and you will find more abt cancer. so sad loved this product:((((
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;Smells just like the perfect beach day. Helps keep my wavy hair frizz free and soft
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;I used this shampoo in combination with the matching conditioner while I was housesitting and it was so wonderful. My hair was light and soft and had slip again. My hair is super long and super thick and it tends to get a bit heavy and unmanageable at its worst. But this combo made it feel light and soft. Plus it smelled wonderful, to boot!

Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;Got this for my fiancé! he absolutely loves them. they make his hair smell like a tropical vacation and make his hair so soft! even the smaller size is still plenty of product!! def recommend :)
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;Got for a christmas gift for my boyfriend! he absolutely loved them, even the smaller size is still huge and plenty of product! They make his hair super soft and smell amazing :)
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;I've been using this shampoo for years. I love that it's sulfate-free and it smells like the tropics. I have fine, wavy hair and it makes just enough of a lather to make it feel clean without the intense lather of other shampoos that contain harsh chemicals.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;This is one of worst shampoo and conditioner combos I've used. I can't go nearly as long between washes without my hair getting oily (a couple days at most), my scalp itches, my hair is frizzy and dry. It looks so dead.I don't even like the scent. The only redeeming quality is that the conditioner does a good job detangling.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;This product smells really good and felt nice going into my hair while it was wet, but once my hair dried, it was really frizzy and actually felt really dry. I probably will not buy again
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;Make my hair soft but make my sculpt more oil and itchy.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;Love love love this! The coconut is my favorite one. It is noticeably better for my hair based on the ingredients and my hair feels so much healthier
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;Love this Shampoo/Conditioner combo. Bought when it was on sale and I love it. Makes my hair soft, smell good, scalp feels super soft.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;Love this Shampoo/Conditioner combo. Bought when it was on sale and I love it. Makes my hair soft, smell good, scalp feels super soft.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;This shampoo dried my hair out so bad it constantly looked dead and tangled next day I used a better shampoo and my hair looks so much better and healthier!
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;I will not repurchase this shampoo. I feel like I have to use conditioner every time to replenish the moisture in my hair. It foams up very well but I feel like my hair becomes dry.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;There are many reasons why I like this! It's affordable, it seems AMAZING, it is sulfate free so it doesn't dry out and strip my hair after a wash, and I feel like it's good for my natural, low porosity hair! I recommend!
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;I had been using the Coconut one from this company that says it's for Curls and was very nice and made my hair soft and showed the curls nicely and gave volumn as well as smelled like you just went to the beach. Sadly.........no one has it and this is NOT a replacement it does smell nice... it made my hair feel horrible. I would not recommend it and would recommend the other one that said CURLS and no it's not the same with a different name bc I had a drop left and compared them.. no comparison.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;I feel itching in the scalp and hair tangled up to a bunch at the end, just like your hairs accidently stick to a gum.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;I have super thick, curly hair and have always struggled with damaged ends. This product makes my hair look and feel a lot healthier!
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;I've given this shampoo multiple tries, but it dries out my scalp so badly and creates dandruff. When I switched back to my typical shampoo, my dandruff went away and it wasn't even an anti dandruff shampoo.  It's unfortunate because I like the way this shampoo makes my hair feel, I just can't stand the dry and itchy scalp.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;My hair has been a struggle. My roots get super oily, and my ends are really dry (probably need a trim, lol). I bought this shampoo, along with the matching conditioner, because I needed something new. It made my hair feel super soft and healthy, my roots weren't oily after one day like usual, and my ends felt hydrated. It also makes my hair smell amazing.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;While it smells good, it's incredibly drying and makes your hair brittle and frizzy. If any shampoo gives makes your hair feel squeaky or hard to run your hands through when you rinse it out, it's doing more harm than good. I used to think that feeling meant it was clean but I was wrong
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;i used this product once with my usual hair products and my hair was so brittle, tangled and unmanageable. as soon as i started using my normal conditioner my hair was soft and untangled again.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;You smell great and look great. You don't do a ton for my hair but I still love you. You make my hair not frizzy and I love you. Keep it up, babe.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel. Never had any problems and always find myself coming back esp since I dye my hair and need a product that won't strip my color and will also protect my hair from harsh chemicals.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel. Never had any problems and always find myself coming back esp since I dye my hair and need a product that won't strip my color and will also protect my hair from harsh chemicals.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;I've been using this conditioner and shampoo version for over a year and my hair is soft to the touch! I can't help myself to a good deal I couldn't pass up! Recommend for anyone with dry damaged hair.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;Shampoo didn't have as much foam as expected
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;I really like the smell of it- it's very subtle. It made my hair very soft and shiny. I have long, thick, wavy hair and I need something that won't make it frizzy. This didn't! The texture is a bit weird but it works for my hair. I would recommend using with the conditioner for the best results though.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;This stuff will kill your hair over time. Sulfate free or not, it makes me think maybe there is a reason why other companies opt for sulfate and not sulfonate (which is what this shampoo uses.) I felt like I was washing my hair with dish soap. I've used the conditioner in the past and I hate it too! The conditioner is watery and does not compensate for the harshness of the shampoo. If this is what sulfate free hair care feels like, I would rather stick with cheaper shampoos like Pantene or Herbal Essence. I bought this shampoo yesterday because I could not find my usual shampoo. I decided to give this brand's shampoo a try since it has such raging reviews. I deeply regret buying this product!
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;You could use this stuff to wash your car. Just because this stuff is advertised as being better for your hair does not make it true. If you don't believe me, try it for yourself. Also, the conditioner is watery and doesn't compensate for how harsh the shampoo is. I would 100% recommend literally any other shampoo to you besides this one. This stuff will kill your hair over time guaranteed. If you like having dry, frizzy, brittle hair, by all means, use this shampoo!
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;I use the tea tree oil ogx shampoo because if i don't i will get dandruff. But for conditioner, i do not like the tea tree oil smell so i like to finish off with this conditioner and let me tell youu! It left my hair looking amazing. It's shiny and so smooth. Before i used this coconut milk, iwas using the tea tree oil ogx shampoo and conditioner. And i hated the smell after i got out the shower. And my hair was soo tangled up to till i switched the conditioner to this one.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;I love the way this smells! It made my hair soft and manageable! Good for the price! Big bottle will last awhile!
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;After using this my hair felt very rough and stripped. I had to use a lot of conditioner to soothe the hair again for moisture
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;I love the fact that the shampoo has no sulfate in it.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;Smells great and feels great on my ends, but left my scalp oily. This is for someone with either very dry scalp or very long hair.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;I need to try a new shampoo. This one is a good price and good quality. Plus it smells great.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;This has worked really well for my permed hair, and for my husband who has very tight natural curls. I like it better than the DevaCurl conditioner that I've tried for several weeks! I will continue to repurchase it.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;I love using OGX! For this coconut milk conditioner specifically for a dye I've been using in my hair, as someone recommended it to me. Kept the undertones in check and hydrated my hair! AND the coconut fragrance isn't overwhelming, which is something I'm typically paranoid about with anything coconut-scented.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;It dried up my hair big time using it
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;This is a Great product!! I've bought OGX products for years for my boys hair. It does a great job keeping their scalps and hair in good shape. Thanks OGX, you've been a life saver with your wonderful products that I can trust for my family!!
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;I was pleasantly surprised at how much I actually ended up liking this shampoo and conditioner. I bought the travel size because I had run out of my reg custom shampoo and it hadn't arrived in time for my wash day so I didn't want to waste too much money on a different shampoo. I picked this one up, not really expecting to like it since I've tried ogx in the past and not liked the result. However, I would buy this again. It was perfect for my curly hair, it didn't weight it down, didn't leave it frizzy, and didn't over dry it nor leave it greasy. I wouldn't change it for my custom shampoo but I would definitely use it again.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;It makes my hair feel so soft
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;I have average to thin straight hair and even when using a handful, I still have a head of hair full of knots. It's about as effective as using your shampoo as a conditioner.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;I bought this and the coconut curls (shampoo and conditioner) this killed/damaged my boyfriends curls. His hair fell out in clumps in the shower.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;This product is amazing FOR CURLY HAIR. I'm tired of all the negative comments coming from people with thin fine hair. Almost every hair care brand is made for y'all so go find something else 😭😂 thanks.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;Really nice conditioner. Not too heavy, not too light and smells great. Makes my hair feel soft.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;I used to use this several years ago... idk if they've changed the formula or what but I've been using this for the past week and MY HAIR!! It tangles so easy now and  I've been shedding like crazy. My hair is super dried out and I don't know why. I can't wait to change shampoos. Save your money!
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;I usually love ofc products and was due for some new shampoo and conditioner and decided to give it a try as it looked like it would be moisturizing. Boy was I wrong. This was actually a very drying shampoo that I felt as I was washing my hair I left my ends very broken after a trim! It was terrible, and the conditioner is no better. I don't recommend this to anyone . they need to change the formula or do something because this does the exact opposite of what it's made to do.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;Put on in shower. Felt really soft. Hair felt dry and hard to brush through after shower. Had to re-condition.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;I love this conditioner so much that I even use it when I don't use an OGX shampoo.  The scent is so nice and comforting.  Even better still is the fact that it isn't too heavy for my hair like a lot of conditioners are.  It's perfectly nourishing for my ends and keeps the flyaways away without making my scalp look like I lathered in butter.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;I love this shampoo so much I keep coming back to it after I think I can try to use other products.  The smell is just so delightful and the quality is awesome for the price.  I even come back to this shampoo after venturing out to try other OGX shampoo lines.  They just don't do it for me like this one does.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;This has to be the worst conditioner ever made. I think it actually removes moisture from hair rather than adding it. Don't let the coconut smell fool you. Your realistically better off not using conditioner.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;First, I tried the trial size of this shampoo/conditioner and loved it. It made my hair look and feel healthy. It made it very soft, without being weighed down. I could also go 3 days without washing it as it didn't make my hair greasy. I have long, straight, and fine hair (but a lot of it). This made me go out and buy the full size bottles (13 oz). However, I found that I wasn't getting the same results whenever I used the full size products. The full size left my hair dry on the ends with a greasy scalp, weird residue, and light dandruff on my scalp. But the worst part is the hair loss. Throughout the day, I would notice strands fall out. This product causes a lot of breakage and hair loss. It's just terrible. The last time I used this product I compared the shampoo/conditioner to the trial versions and noticed completely different consistencies when putting them side by side on my hand. So it appears as though they use higher quality ingredients in the trial bottles in order to trap you into buying the awful full size products. I am done using cheaper brands like ogx and hask. Both caused hair loss and other issues. I am now using carol's daughter, which is more expensive, but not outrageous. I've only used it once but so far my hair feels so much better so I'm hoping and praying this is the right product for me as I've been searching for awhile. Btw I can only use sulfate free brands as I have a sensitive scalp.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;Just a little goes a long way.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;I shampoo daily. This product makes my hair feel so clean and soft. I also use the conditioner. Using both makes my hair look and feel amazing. I love it!
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;I'm seeing some negative comments and I think it's because people arent letting it stay on their hair long enough. I put it in my hair, leave it for 3 to 5 minutes, and then rinse it. Also..I did hate it at first. But you have to use this for a long period of time for it to really start working its magic. It also smells really good!!
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;The shampoo and conditioner are great for a thorough cleaning of your hair. My hair looked healthy after I used it and it felt great.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;I feel bad for any person with thick and dry hair who may use this product, because I have fine and thinning hair without results. I leave the conditioner in for a good five minutes, but it still leaves my hair tangled and dry, particularly at the ends.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;Love the price that I paid for will buy this product  again.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;I looked through so many reviews before buying this product but I have to say, it was well worth every penny! The shampoo doesn't leather too much which didn't bother me. I think the key to not having greasy hair with this product is just using it properly. I lather from root to tip with the shampoo and only use the conditioner everywhere but the roots. I straightened my hair the same day and omg it came out beautiful. Usually by day 2, I start getting greasy towards the roots but I'm not greasy and my hair is so soft and shiny!
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;I like this shampoo for daily use. However, it doesn't get the job done if your hair is more than just a little dirty. Usually requires 2 washes. Smells amazing and seems to increase the curl in my hair which is nice. After reading some of the other reviews, I think this product may be causing my hair to fall out more than normal. Nevertheless, I think it's a pretty good product for the price and convenience. Better than other drugstore products.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;This conditioner is light and effective for daily use. I really like it for the price! I wouldn't say it provides a ton of moisture, but it's a great simple daily conditioner. One of my go-to's.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Conditioner;I was excited to try this shampoo since my hair is wavy/curly and needs extra moisture, especially in the dry winter months. I figured this would be a good option and it smelled great! Usually I can wash my hair every three or four days without it looking greasy and the curls still intact..not so with this product. After about two weeks use, I've noticed that my hair gets greasy very, very quickly and my curls last about a day. They're also not nearly as tight as usual. Sadly, I'll be returning this product.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Shampoo;Read that causes cancer :/ other than that AMAZING. do more research about ogx and you will find more abt cancer. so sad loved this product:((((
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Shampoo;Smells just like the perfect beach day. Helps keep my wavy hair frizz free and soft
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Shampoo;I used this shampoo in combination with the matching conditioner while I was housesitting and it was so wonderful. My hair was light and soft and had slip again. My hair is super long and super thick and it tends to get a bit heavy and unmanageable at its worst. But this combo made it feel light and soft. Plus it smelled wonderful, to boot!

Nourishing + Coconut Milk Shampoo;Got this for my fiancé! he absolutely loves them. they make his hair smell like a tropical vacation and make his hair so soft! even the smaller size is still plenty of product!! def recommend :)
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Shampoo;Got for a christmas gift for my boyfriend! he absolutely loved them, even the smaller size is still huge and plenty of product! They make his hair super soft and smell amazing :)
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Shampoo;I've been using this shampoo for years. I love that it's sulfate-free and it smells like the tropics. I have fine, wavy hair and it makes just enough of a lather to make it feel clean without the intense lather of other shampoos that contain harsh chemicals.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Shampoo;This is one of worst shampoo and conditioner combos I've used. I can't go nearly as long between washes without my hair getting oily (a couple days at most), my scalp itches, my hair is frizzy and dry. It looks so dead.I don't even like the scent. The only redeeming quality is that the conditioner does a good job detangling.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Shampoo;This product smells really good and felt nice going into my hair while it was wet, but once my hair dried, it was really frizzy and actually felt really dry. I probably will not buy again
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Shampoo;Make my hair soft but make my sculpt more oil and itchy.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Shampoo;Love love love this! The coconut is my favorite one. It is noticeably better for my hair based on the ingredients and my hair feels so much healthier
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Shampoo;Love this Shampoo/Conditioner combo. Bought when it was on sale and I love it. Makes my hair soft, smell good, scalp feels super soft.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Shampoo;Love this Shampoo/Conditioner combo. Bought when it was on sale and I love it. Makes my hair soft, smell good, scalp feels super soft.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Shampoo;This shampoo dried my hair out so bad it constantly looked dead and tangled next day I used a better shampoo and my hair looks so much better and healthier!
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Shampoo;I will not repurchase this shampoo. I feel like I have to use conditioner every time to replenish the moisture in my hair. It foams up very well but I feel like my hair becomes dry.
Nourishing + Coconut Milk Shampoo;There are many reasons why I like this! It's affordable, it seems AMAZING, it is sulfate free so it doesn't dry out and strip my hair after a wash, and I feel like it's good for my natural, low porosity hair! I recommend!

I would not recommend it and would recommend the other one that said CURLS and no it's not the same with a different name bc I had a drop left and compared them.. no comparison.

ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;When I first used it, it made my hair soft. I've been using it for a few months maybe close to a year now and I've seen a lot of hair loss and my hair feels dried out and more tangled. Then I read about the lawsuit OGX is in right now and decided to stop using it went to Ulta and got another more organic shampoo.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;Please research class action lawsuit before buying OGX shampoo and conditioner!!!
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;My dry hair is soft and smelling good love it
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;My hair is so soft and it still smells clean and no extra grease
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;Great shampoo made my dry hair feel soft without weighing it down. Nice clean fragrance.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;My boyfriend has a very bad scalp psoriasis. Every shampoo and conditioner he is ever used has made it way worse. We finally got him started on this shampoo and conditioner and now he hardly has any flareups. I would definitely recommend it also smells wonderful
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;This product makes my hair silky and moisturized and it feels stronger. For a year or so I used whatever shampoo, I didn't really care but I noticed my hair got really dry and didn't grow as fast. I also noticed a lot of hair fall, so I decided to switch to this brand because it is sulfate free. I started with the golden turmeric shampoo and it helped a little but still didn't give me the results I wanted so I switched to the argon oil one and I've seen a big improvement already. I am going to stick to this shampoo because it makes my hair feel very healthy and strong. I also like the conditioner as well.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;This was my holy grail conditioner for about five years, but the new reformulation is just terrible. It smells worse, is thinner, I have to use much more than I used to and it barely seems to do anything for my hair. My hair is wavy/curly/frizzy and thick so I really need a conditioner that does the work, and this just doesn't anymore.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;it smelled amazing and it lathered very well. however, my scalp started to burn right after i put it in my hair. idk if it will happen to anyone else but it did to me.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;This is my all time favorite shampoo. Made my dry hair moisturized and soft. But I hate how there's DMDM hydantoin😩
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;This was great for my hair!! After just one use, my hair was soft shiny, and was no longer greasy! 10/10 would recommend
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;This was great for my hair!! After just one use, my hair was soft shiny, and was no longer greasy! 10/10 would recommend
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;"Don't use this!!! It has DMDM hydantoin which when mixed with water (you know, like when you're washing your freaking hair) becomes FORMALDEHYDE. It is a toxic chemical and a known CARCINOGEN. Which if you don't know, means it can cause CANCER. It also can cause your hair to fall out and begin balding. If you don't believe me please Google! This is as far from ""orangix""/organic as you can get."
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;Can't believe I finally found something to tame my wavy frizz, and it's a drugstore brand. This stuff is gold.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;This product worked wonders for my hair . I bought the small one just to try it out and I like it better then my regular shampoo and conditioner (dove)
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;Add texture or fragrance in between shampoo's
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;"I used to love this stuff years ago. The smell was so good but different from regular ""fresh"" smelling things, like a darker but sweeter scent. I bought this and remembered how the conditioner worked great on my long straight hair. They must have changed the formula bc now it was like I didnt use any conditioner on my hair at all. And i use a lot everytime because my hair is so long. Even when rinsing it out it didnt feel as silky as any other conditioner like it did the opposite and dried it out. Same when it is wet and out of the shower combing it out was like I didnt use any conditioner at all and in knots and tangles. Also when I dried it just seemed like it didnt condition at all. I've never had this problem with any other conditioners or shampoos. But I forgot and repurchased it thinking it was going to be how I remembered it and same thing dry dry dry. The conditioner did nothing for my hair except dry it out. I wish it worked like it used to bc it smells so different and good."
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;my hair felt just as dry as it was before. it really did nothing
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;I dont like how this smells at all. The spray worked okay but I have used better dry shampoos for cheaper/same price.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;This is the worst product I've ever used. After hearing about it for like forever I decided to give it a try.. It made my hair sooooo dryyyyy like wooow I can not believe that there are people out there that love this product. It's the worst.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;this product gives my skin an allergic reaction but i still use it bc it's THAT good
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;i've almost used the whole bottle and at this point have to buy a clarifying shampoo to get rid of all the buildup this product leaves. i've used it with the conditioner and it leaves my hair greasy. i usually don't have that problem with other shampoos. definitely won't repurchase and don't recommend
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;I was progressing so well with my hair and the length and thickness was amazing. I wanted something to give it a bit more shine and life so I tried this out and it did nothing but strip my hair of everything and make it super frizzy/damaged again. Don't buy it.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;Love this shampoo and conditioner. I use it on my coarse wavy hair and it helps reduce frizz and smooth it out.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;I tried this a couple of times before I threw it away because each time it made my hair sticky and didn't absorb the oil from my hair. It was almost like using hairspray, not dry shampoo. It smells amazing which is why I wanted to try it but I'll stick with Batiste from now on.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;I have gave this products two chances but it's not a good product. The price is good but Leaves hair dry and frizzy.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;This shampoo and conditioner duo smells really good, the bottles are fun colors and it sounds like it's good for the environment. However, it's disgusting beyond that. It makes my hair so sticky at the roots (which after doing some reading, sounds as if it is because it is sulfate free.) Also, the shampoo is very thick. I write this review after spending nearly a hour trying to clean the residue from it out of my shower. I needed chemicals that are probably not good for the environment to clean it, making it a loose loose situation environmentally.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;I really Enjoy the OGX Brands . They do not cause my scalp to flare up or dry out my hair . Going on a Trip , I found this travel size & was over the moon .
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;I give this a 5 just from the smell of the shampoo and the way my hair feels after using it. It really makes my hair feel nice and leaves my curly and frizzy hair with a more maintainable feel afterwards. also leaves my hair smelling so amazing that I will use time and time again
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;Love
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;best conditioner ever for my wavy hair. smells like heaven< 3
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;Great conditioner.  Smells great and makes my hair smell great.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;I really like this shampoo.  It smells good and makes my hair soft.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;I've been using the Dry Bar dry shampoo for years now, and consider it holy grail as it does what it's supposed to do as a dry shampoo which is cancel out the greasiness of the hair and make it look fresh. This product didn't make my hair less greasy and did not absorb the oil. It does smell good though.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;My hair looked much healthier, shinier, and bouncier after a few washes with the shampoo and matching conditioner. It also smells really good and retains the smell for a few days.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;When I bought this conditioner, I had no idea what to expect. I bought it a few weeks ago with the intentions of fixing my damaged, dry hair before I dyed it again! When I got this in the mail, I was NOT disappointed! The scent of the conditioner itself can be compared to cocoa butter in terms of smell, though not as much of a strong sweet aroma. I used the conditioner in the shower, and after the first wash, there was a SUPER distinguishable difference in the texture of my hair! It made my hair soft to the touch. By far the most fast-working conditioner I've ever used, and I plan on getting a full-sized bottle very soon!
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;I bought the minis for my trip to Los Angeles and fell in love with this shampoo(and the conditioner.) Smells so good to me and left my hair silky. I always let my hair air dry as I don't use heat on my hair and there was no frizz. I have medium/fine wavy hair for reference.  Highly recommend!
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;I've used some of the other OGX shampoo/conditioners that made my hair feel great, but this shampoo specifically was terrible. I got a huge bottle of the Argan oil shampoo/conditioner on sale and noticed that even though I had just gotten a haircut my hair became dry with split ends very quickly. I'm using up the conditioner with other shampoo brands. Namely head and shoulders because this also made my scalp dry or caused buildup. However, it seems there's no saving the shampoo. Might just be my hair type which is straight and fine.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;Gave me BAD dandruff and drys out my hair! Would never use again
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;My hair was dry from the shampoo, but the conditioner restored my hair. If using the shampo o, you MUST use the conditioner as well.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;It works as a shampoo. Great smell. Left my hair a bit dry though, but not too much to where I wouldn't use again, I will purchase more.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;The shampoo and conditioner if this is amazing for daily use. Also, I love the pleasant smell. Smells clean and simple. Its perfect for my color treated hair.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;I am not sure how this product is on the market. As soon as I started using it, I developed scalp pain. I wasn't sure if it was the shampoo so I continued using and realized I was losing my hair in large amounts. As soon as I switched shampoos the pain subsided and I noticed my hair was not falling off as much. I am not sure what ingredients this shampoo and conditioner have that could have caused so much damage in the 1 week that i used it.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;I love you this shampoo.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;Love it. Simple. Inexpensive
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;Was wondering if you changed the formula? I've been using ogx argan oil shampoo amd this time around it it different and really thick and doesn't smell good. Normally its awesome. I wonder if I just got an old batch?
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;I've been using this conditioner for years. The shampoo id also recommend but I use the conditioner way more. It's honestly a great product. I've spent $$$ on conditioner products before and this one is well below that price range. It easily comparable if not better than the higher priced ones anyway. If you can find the larger sized bottle, grab it. Otherwise the smaller one is most common in stores. It's great for daily use, or every couple days. I use it as a leave in conditioner, although most often people opt against using a regular conditioner as a leave-in. It's safe for your hair and I've had no issues. I will continue to buy this product over and over again.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;SMELLS GREAT AND WORKS WONDERFUL
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;I bought the travel size as I'm trying to test other dry shampoos out to see if I should switch brands, but nope I continue goin back to my batiste as I have not found anything better! This smells great and sprays on easily and evenly, however it's does absolutely nothing. My hair still feels oily and dirty. Wouldn't buy again.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;hair conditioner
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;Only used once have not formed a opinion yet.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;The shampoo worked pretty well for me but I am not a fan of the conditioner. It did not make my hair feel soft and it was very hard to brush my hair after showering. The hair felt dry and more frizzier than ever. I do not use heat on my hair anymore and before using this product I never had an issue with tangled hair after the shower. I feel like the conditioner just doesn't work and once air dried, my hair felt not very clean. I couldn't run my fingers through my hair without hitting a knot. I'm disappointed because I felt this would help with my wavy, frizzy hair but if anything it has dried my hair and made my hair hard to brush causing me to loose hair due to tangled hair.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;I was hoping to find another dry shampoo to love but this was not it, especially disappointed because other products from this brand are great. It doesn't have the smooth and powdery feel of some others, it just feels and smells like putting cheap hairspray in your hair. I hated the way it made my hair feel and it wasn't very voluminous or oil absorbent either. Made my hair tangle easily. I would only use this to add texture to my hair for styling an updo, but not as a dry shampoo.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;My hair was getting dry. This shampoo makes it softer, it's still clean and it smells great!
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;This conditioner doesn't make your hair look bad. The negative thing about it is that the argan oil made me break out all over my face and hairline. At first I didn't know what was wrong because I totally forgot that I had added this to my routine. Then I realized after over a month of getting acne on my cheeks which I have never before in my entire life... that it was this conditioner. I had changed nothing else in my routine except this. It's been 4 days since I stopped using it and my face has already stopped to clear up. I think this would be a nice product if I hadn't broken out all over my face. The results with the hair were not worth it.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;Love this brand. This works very nice on my hair would  defiantly  buy it again
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;I love the shampoo and it save my oily hair daily. My hair usually got oily after 8 hours even using regular shampoo for oily hair. However, the shampoo is a magic and it makes my hair stays clean for 18 hours. Also, never have itchy scalp after using OGX.  The shampoo doesn't dry my hair out, and it makes most parts of my hair hydrate.  It only dries the end of my hair, so I would recommend to use conditioner for the end of the hair. The shampoo smells great and I have purchased more than one bottle.
ARGAN OIL MOROCCO CONDITONER;Wssh my hair 4 days a week.
ARGAN OIL of MOROCCO SHAMPOO;When I first used it, it made my hair soft. I've been using it for a few months maybe close to a year now and I've seen a lot of hair loss and my hair feels dried out and more tangled. Then I read about the lawsuit OGX is in right now and decided to stop using it went to Ulta and got another more organic shampoo.
ARGAN OIL of MOROCCO SHAMPOO;Please research class action lawsuit before buying OGX shampoo and conditioner!!!
ARGAN OIL of MOROCCO SHAMPOO;My dry hair is soft and smelling good love it

Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner;Leaves my hair feeling really clean
Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner;I should have read the ingredients on the back, my fault. It's winter and the humectants alone have brought out some major frizz. not to mention this stuff seriously weighed down my curls, they went from bouncy to flat with frizz. I will say my hair was very soft but if it eliminates my curls, I have no use for it. very disappointed.
Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner;I love the smell of the product. But it left my hair dry and really oily. I bought the oil that matches the scent and only put it on the ends of my hair but it didn't help. Plus I heard it has ingredients that can make your hair fall out.
Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner;i love this, and it is hard to find so I am glad Ulta stocks it.
Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner;I bought this to try out curl products on my hair to see how it would respond.  I got good results and my hair was definitely bouncier and had more waves!  I think it smells so nice and it does a decent job moisturizing my hair.  I've read some things saying this might not be the best product for your hair and while I don't think it's ruined my hair by any means, I don't necessarily think it's done miracles either.  Overall, I like it!
Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner;Not too heavy, very hydrating, great price
Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner;I absolutely love ❤️ this curly shampoo/conditioner this is recipe for beautiful natural curly hair. Takes away the frizz and helps it to look shiny and tamed. Waited way too long to try it. Also try the curly leave in conditioner. OMG 😍. This is a KEEPER!!!
Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner;I don't recommend this for curly hair AT ALL. It was super thin and there was little to no moisture. After rinsing it put it felt like it had done nothing. Maybe if you have thinner less curly hair it would work but other than that........👎🏻
Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner;Like the product very well. Do not like the price at Ulta.
Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner;The shampoo and conditioner in this line are sulfate free, it says so on the bottle. On top of that, I've been using these 2 for months now and can happily say my curls are back! After years of heat damage and not taking care of my curls, I was able to use these products to revive the curl in my hair. I have very frizzy Indian hair, and I've noticed that using these products along with the coconut oil really help keep the frizz down and the curls beautiful. I highly recommended. I haven't noticed any build up on my hair either that some reviews claim. Even my hair dresser compliments how beautiful my hair is!
Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner;I think this product may not be good for people with straight hair but since my hair is curly I think it was just perfect
Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner;I got this for my sons hair. His curls came out so much more hydrated. Then I used it on my daughters hair who's hair is curly at the bottom only and got perfect ringlets. Highly recommend.
Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner;I swore by this company/product until I realized it contains no ingredients to actually benefit naturally curly hair and has harmful ingredients in it.
Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner;Not great for my wavy thick hair however my daughters curly coils came out glorious
Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner;I love using this shampoo and conditioner together!! They have really helped my hair and I love the scent .
Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner;not to be dramatic, but this conditioner c h a n g e d my life. I have frizzy unmanageable hair that even with a lot of anti frizz oil, it would still frizz up. My hair is thick, and I might have tried every anti frizz conditioner out there. This by far, is the best. I'm not even sure if this conditioner focuses on anti frizz, but it definitely did the trick. My hair is literally THRIVING right now.
Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner;I just love when I can lock in moisture because it's so easy for my hair to dry out.
Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner;Apart from the great smell, this shampoo/conditioner combo did nothing for my curls, I still had to use other products to get that bounce. Def not worth purchasing if you're looking for a product that will help maintain your natural curls without the aid of any additional products.
Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner;I was really excited to try this shampoo and conditioner. It smelt so good in store and I have moderate curls, so I gave it a try hoping it would take my frizziness, boost my curls, and leave it smelling good. The first time I used it I kinda noticed that the texture of the shampoo was very different than most, and the conditioner was very watery.. I ignored and applied a normal amount. Within a week of using I noticed my face and back (especially) had broke out worse than ever. Also my hair gets really oily within two days. I do not recommend to anyone with sensitive skin. Will never buy this again.
Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner;I have very think curly hair and i'm always looking for the next best shampoo and conditioner that is affordable and effective and I believe this product is it. Right after the first use I noticed a difference in the amount of shine was more and my curl pattern was way better.
Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner;My black-Hispanic teen daughter uses this and loves it. I love it it makes her hair full curly healthy
Smoothing + Shea Sleek Humidity Blocking Hairspray;Love love love this product!  It's just what I needed thanks!
Smoothing + Shea Sleek Humidity Blocking Hairspray;Best hair spray ever. It's not sticky or crunchy. It smooths and holds my curls in place (without frizz) in the Florida humidity!
Smoothing + Shea Sleek Humidity Blocking Hairspray;Not too heavy, doesn't stink, not sticky. Holds my thin hair very well all day.
Smoothing + Shea Sleek Humidity Blocking Hairspray;Omgshhhh this spray is life ! Best thing I ever use for humidity!
Smoothing + Shea Sleek Humidity Blocking Hairspray;Spray on when hair is damp and it still works like a charm.  Not a fan of the smell.
Smoothing + Shea Sleek Humidity Blocking Hairspray;This product is not very good. Made my hair look greasy
Smoothing + Shea Sleek Humidity Blocking Hairspray;Meh, nothing positive about this product other than the scent
Smoothing + Shea Sleek Humidity Blocking Hairspray;Love this hairspray!! Keeps my hair from frizzing and good hold.
Smoothing + Shea Sleek Humidity Blocking Hairspray;I've tried many hairsprays abd this is by far the best. It controls, but doesn't dry out my fine, wavy/curly hair. Love it!
Smoothing + Shea Sleek Humidity Blocking Hairspray;Love it!
Smoothing + Shea Sleek Humidity Blocking Hairspray;Other sprays in same line work a little better and isn't any help with humidity.
Quenching + Coconut Curls Shampoo;I wanted to get a relatively safe for my hair brand that could help hold my wavy/curly hair without flattening it. Well, flattening it definitely wasn't an issue as it made my hair a frizzy mess. I used this, the conditioner, and the leave in oil mist/spray and nothing would help my frizz. I would bring the oil spray with me to work and spray it on my hair to calm it and a couple hours later, bam, as if I never conditioned it. It has been driving me crazy. I'm going to try Hask now, this just has not worked for me. At least my curls were visible I guess.
Quenching + Coconut Curls Shampoo;"This contains DMDM Hydantoin, a chemical linked to hair fall and scalp burns. Chunks of my hair were falling out and I couldn't understand why for weeks (it was so severe I thought I was developing alopecia). Google ""OGX / Tresemme lawsuit."""
Quenching + Coconut Curls Shampoo;On closer review of the ingredients it has 6 that are known to contribute to thinning, 3 of which are in the first few rows. I have a thinning spot on my right back side thats only showed up since i've been using this. Its did work well on my strands but definitely not my scalp. do NOT use if your hair is thinning
Quenching + Coconut Curls Shampoo;Difficult to squeeze out product. If you have weak hands, DO NOT buy this product. Had to take top off and pour into an easy to use bottle. This is the same for the shampoo.
Quenching + Coconut Curls Shampoo;This product is so watered down, I have to use half the bottle for it to even cover my hair.. horrible.. will not buy again
Quenching + Coconut Curls Shampoo;I love this shampoo. You do not need to use a lot, it leaves hair clean, and smells great.
Quenching + Coconut Curls Shampoo;I'm so glad that I found this shampoo!
Quenching + Coconut Curls Shampoo;this used to be my shampoo for almost a year but I started realizing that my scalp started getting itchy and that I had a lot of dandruff. My curls looked nice but sometimes would be so bad to the point it would burn and one time it was really red and bloody.
Quenching + Coconut Curls Shampoo;I have 2A hair (slightly wavy) and I found this shampoo to be very effective. I've found that this shampoo doesn't dry my hair out or make it prone to oiliness (my two biggest pet peeves with shampoo). It gives my hair a slight bit of volume too. Love it so far!
Quenching + Coconut Curls Shampoo;Great for my curls and my wallet
Quenching + Coconut Curls Shampoo;I didn't like it would not buy  It again. It doesn't lather very well
Quenching + Coconut Curls Shampoo;I have fine, curly hair that has bleached highlights.  This is one of two non-expensive shampoo/conditioner combos that leave my hair soft & shiny.  I've tried other brands and always end up coming back to this one.
Quenching + Coconut Curls Shampoo;Used it once.. my hair was comb-able with the shampoo on.. large tooth comb went thru smoothly and it really smells like coconuts.
Quenching + Coconut Curls Shampoo;I just wish they sold them in larger quantities.
Quenching + Coconut Curls Shampoo;I was shopping for a new hair shampoo/conditioner duo for my thick,curly and frizzy hair. I was looking for something that would eliminate mid day frizz and puffiness and provide the long lasting freshly styled look I was aiming for. Budget is always a factor so that was a huge plus in my decision making while comparing products. My hair needs an extra moisture boost during this time of year in northern MI. The frigid, dry air does not play well with my hair. With all that being said, another factor in my decision was previous reviews. The majority of reviews I read had more pros than cons and overall seemed like a popular vote. For me, being extremely picky and careful of what products I put in my hair, it is saying a lot when I say that I found a winner. This duo (I used this in conjunction with the Coconut Miracle Oil conditioner) is like heaven for my hair and I plan on sticking with it! If you are looking for help with your thick/curly/frizzy/dry strands...give Quenching Coconut Curls shampoo a try and thank me later!
Quenching + Coconut Curls Shampoo;I use the product for wash days as a clarifying shampoo, it cleans but strips my hair of most natural oils, I have to follow up with a moisturizing shampoo.
Quenching + Coconut Curls Shampoo;Love the way this shampoo makes my hair feel and react!
Quenching + Coconut Curls Shampoo;I have been using this shampoo and the conditioner for about 3 months now and at first i loved it but recently i noticed that my hair began to dry out and i have buildup in my scalp now and also the scent does not stay. This had never happened to me before w any other brands i've tried. I loved it at first but i'm gonna have to go back to deva curl or try a different brand.
Quenching + Coconut Curls Shampoo;I finished a bottle of conditioner and shampoo, I've noticed that my hair is bouncy again and it does a great job moisturizing. Sometimes I can just wash my hair without using the conditioner and it's still moisturized and easy to brush through.
Quenching + Coconut Curls Shampoo;Apart from the great smell, this shampoo/conditioner combo did nothing for my curls, I still had to use other products to get that bounce. Def not worth purchasing if you're looking for a product that will help maintain your natural curls without the aid of any additional products.
Quenching + Coconut Curls Shampoo;Teen daughter black-Hispanic loves how this makes her natural curl look
Quenching + Coconut Curls Shampoo;I wanted to love this, as it smells incredible and the conditioner works well ( a few days per week I condition, sans shampoo). However, aside from being extremely drying, my hair fell out in clumps after one wash! That never happens when using other Curl-specific shampoos, so unfortunately, I'll be returning this.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I have been using this product for a few months & have lost so much hair since I have been using. I did not think it was related to the product until I did some research.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I've been using this product for several months, and it left my hair in worse condition than before.  It's way too soft -- and fly-away!  None of which is an improvement over no conditioner at all.  The only good thing I experienced with this product is the fragrance -- if it was a product that did even the minimum of what any conditioner should do, I would buy it just for the fragrance.  Too bad, because I love other OGX products.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;It'll make your hair feel full and give volume, but at the same time it'll weigh it down. Your hair will become oily, and be due for a wash compared to normal time.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I bought this shampoo hoping I could achieve more thick and voluminous hair. However, after using this product only 2 times it left a waxy/sticky coat over my hair and actually made me loose hair. I have never used a product that made me loose so much hair especially if it claims to strengthen your hair
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;As a conditioner
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;i am so disappointed that a product I have used forever has changed. I noticed no difference in shampoo. But this new formula for the conditioner is just sad. totally dries out hair as if theres no conditioner in it at all. My first clue was it was not squeezing out of the bottle right. It actually tangles my hair leaving it hard now and not soft and easy to get a wide tooth comb through this thin hair. I am so disappointed and am going to have to change brands. I pulled out a sample bottle and then this. The ingredient's are switched around and some changed. I am going to have to throw away a bottle 3/4 full. I used so much last night to try to make it work and its still horrid.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Not sure if this is a bad bottle, but I have a heck of a time getting product out of container, and when I do, its just a blob and it doesn't lather up.  Not to impressed at this point.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I was surprised I liked this shampoo and conditioner so much. I think the people who didn't like it probably were using it every time they washed their hair. I alternate with a higher quality shampoo and conditioner (lanza and a purple shampoo) and I've never had a problem with build up. Im obsessed with the smell! I can go to bed with my hair wet and just brush it in the morning and it looks like I just had a blow out.  Is this the best shampoo and conditioner for the health of your hair? Probably not.. but its a good one to have in the shower for the days you want something different.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Smells absolutely awful, would NOT recommend!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;"This is the strangest shampoo (and the conditioner) to me. I am used to shampoos that feel frothy and rich, and conditioners that feel silky when I rinse them out. I do a lot of detangling with my fingers in the shower because my hair is so long. It's well past my waist, almost to the top of my legs. Finger detangling in the shower helps prevent a lot of breakage. This shampoo (and the conditioner) scared me at first. I could hardly get my fingers through my hair. It knotted up when I shampooed, and took forever to get the knots out. The shampoo seemed to completely strip my hair, or so it felt. I'm talking SQUEEEEEAKY clean. I assumed that when it dried, it would look like a broom. But it didn't. I also used the conditioner, which didn't give me a warm fuzzy feeling, either. I didn't use any detangler or hair oil out of the shower because I wanted to see exactly how this stuff worked for me. I carefully detangled with a flat detangling brush and let it air dry. And it looked amazing! I was shocked. My hair was so shiny and soft. It had lots of movement, and my waves had definition. I've used about half of both bottles so far, and I'm not seeing any change. My hair doesn't seem to be drying out or breaking, and I haven't noticed any unusual hair fall. I'm still on the fence, though, because it's so difficult to detangle. The ""after"" is great for me. It's getting there that's difficult, and I don't like spending ages on my hair. I want to wash, detangle, and let it air dry on its own."
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Great product!! Loved it! Give a heavy hair look. happy with purchase.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I recently cut my waist-length hair off to about my jawline, and was seriously concerned about volume. My hair has always been super thin, so when I chopped it off, I was instantly on the hunt for a good voluming shampoo. I work at Ulta and despite my employee discount, I'm not a fan of dropping a ton of money on shampoos because I like to mix mine to get various benefits. OGX has worked great for me in the past and I love that it's cruelty free and very affordable. While this shampoo in particular doesn't smell the ~best~ it works AMAZING. My hair has gotten some SERIOUS volume since I've started using it and I've found myself using less volumizing styling products just because I don't want my hair to look poofy! Can't say I've had to deal with that before! Overall, I totally recommend and will plan on getting this again once I run out!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;So far I love it
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This made my hair feel dry and as if there was a coat of sticky wax covering it - will not be buying again
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I have used several different kinds of shampoo and this one made my thin post postpartum hair thick and healthy
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;After trying this product for two months, I'm going tomorrow to get my long hair cut off at my neck because it feels like straw, is breaking, and falling out.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I read the other reviews about the DMDM in this that causes hair loss. After using this shampoo my hair falls out, is dry and brittle. Looking at the ingredients on Ulta's website, the DMDM is not listed. On the bottle in my shower it's listed plain as day!! Why didn't ulta include it on their ingredients?! That's shady.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This shampoo knotted my hair up so bad, and I experienced so much hair loss. Honestly while I was using it I never thought anything of it until i seen that other people were experiencing the same issue, it also dried out my hair. Never will purchase this again!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;The best product ever if you have damaged hair
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I've been using this for about 2 years, thinking it was good for my hair. WRONG! It has DMDM Hydantoin as well as other ingredients that DAMAGE your hair and cause HAIR LOSS! As a 27-yr old experiencing hair loss, this is not okay!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I decided to try this after reading an article rating shampoos for thin hair, (this was the reasonably priced option) and boy I'm sure glad I did! My very fine, very thin hair seems thicker and fuller after only about a week of daily washing! It also does not seem to be drying like other shampoos I've tried. I was very skeptical, but this has certainly lived up to it's recommendation. I definitely recommend it.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Unfortunately I used this for years since it's sulfate and paraben free. However it has DMDM hydantoin!!! This is no better than using tresemme. Look up the lawsuits and save your hair. I switched to hempz shampoo and conditioner
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;My husband used this product, and his scalp was very irritated.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I started noticing hair loss after a few times using this shampoo and conditioner. At the time I didnt think none of it until my shower got clogged. When I unclogged it and seen the amount of hair I lost I wanted to cry. I immediately threw the product away and stopped using it. I then googled what causes hair loss and seen that this product contains DMDM hydantoin and sodium chloride. Which both ingredients are bad for your scalp & causes hair loss.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I used it for 3 times now. It's really good shampoo. The only negative thing - the smell is too strong.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I can't honestly rate this for how it works but I will tell you if you don't like that fake coconut smell that smells like a car air freshener, you will hate this smell.  It's just like it.  Must return.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;After using the shampoo and conditioner for only one week, my hair has so much volume and looks healthy!  I am not losing hair as I was before.  So impressed with this product!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This product smells great and leaves my hair soft
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I've been using this shampoo for a few weeks now, because I wanted my hair to feel thicker and more voluminous. The first few times I used it, I thought my hair looked super shiny and clean. As I've continued to use it, I've noticed a drastic REDUCTION in my hair's volume. My hair is so limp and feels incredibly thin now. The shampoo smells good and it does make my hair shiny, but it is not worth all the fall out!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;So I tried switching to different shampoos and conditioners to see differences, and I always go back to this!! The only shampoo and conditioner that leaves my hair so soft and healthy feeling. My hair grew the longest when I used this. Will always stick with it!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Seriously like food for my hair!! Thankful & please do not change formula or do anything with this product! Life changing!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I purchased this after seeing thousands of great reviews of several sites. I question if the reviews are legit because this stuff is terrible! The shampoo along with the conditioner will dry out your hair! My hair was so dry, coarse and difficult to straighten with a straightener after using this. Usually after shampooing and conditioning, your hair immediately becomes softer and you can run your fingers through it. I couldn't run my fingers through my hair at all in the shower with the conditioner that goes along with this shampoo. The texture / fragrance of this stuff reminds me of something you'd find at a cheap discount store. It is not worth the price. I am throwing both bottles out and purchasing new ones because it is ruining my hair!!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Dried my hair out severely and made it start falling out! I've always been super self conscious of my thin hair and now it's worse than before. So disappointed.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I wash my hair twice a week while it stays full and soft and  feeling good with how my hair feels.  With what I was using left a coating and flats on my hair and I lost more hair.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;"I honestly am torn between liking and disliking this product. The shampoo and conditioner does what it's labeled to do, my hair is noticeable thicker and has more texture. However, it's almost thick to the point where it has lost all natural shape and bounce and just wants to poof out like a box around my head. It's almost crunchy. On top of that, the product leaves a waxy film on your hair and on your skin that is impossible to rinse out completely. I guess that's what makes your hair feel ""thicker""? It smells really strong too, like reallyyyy strong. I like the smell because it reminds me of warm vanilla sugar, but sensitive users beware. Like I said, does the job, but due to its quirks I will not be repurchasing."
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I bought this shampoo and conditioner desperately looking for something to help me with my rapidly thinning hair.  My hair has gotten so thin that I can see my scalp throughout it so I was hoping to find a product to help add volume.  At first the product was really helping my hair look great, and then I started to notice a film being left on my scalp after showering no matter how well I rinsed my hair.  This film made my hair feel grimy and my scalp was itchy....so the search for a perfect shampoo and conditioner continues.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Where has this been my whole life!!! It smells amazing, my hair feels so much thicker, shinier, so soft and not frizzy at all. I love love love this formula.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Smells nice but made my hair feel incredibly dry. I have tried other organix products and loved them but the collagen ones just dry out my hair for some reason.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;i was a little sceptical about trying it because of all the bad reviews but i figured hey why not my hair was already falling out ALOT and i mean literal bunches of hair i was so depressed about it and decided to give it a try let me tell you i was so happy to see only a couple hairs go down the drain after i showered i also noticed it helped with the itching on my scalp i was so sick of using head and shoulders it made my hair stink! this one smells sweet like vanilla :) the only bad thing is it does make your hair dry so i use the ogx coconut serum for that  , other than that i love how full my hair feels now and also how much it stopped falling out
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I used this shampoo religiously for two or three years now. I loved the smell and it gave good softness and volume to my thin, fine hair. I recently noticed more and more of my hair falling out in the shower and began to fear the worst, like a hormone issue, until I happened to read a review for this shampoo and everyone else was mentioning hair loss. Put it in the trash immediately and moved on to a new brand and the hair loss is slowly stopping but it's going to be a long journey to get it back to normal.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This shampoo turned into gel after two weeks! It's super sticky now and can't be washed out of my hair. It was even hard to get off of my hands. The first few uses were good but i had to throw it away after only a few weeks
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I was using this shampoo and conditioner for a while because I have fine hair, and lack of volume, so it seemed like a great solution! I started using it for a few months and noticed the hair appeared to be thicker, and slightly more voluminous. However, shortly after, I got my hair colored and bought some salon quality shampoo and conditioner to protect the color and used that. Flash Forward, the salon hair product is gone and I switch back to this product. I didn't think anything of it at first, I noticed my hair didn't feel as soft but wasn't too bothered by it. A few days of using it and I'm noticing my hair will not stop getting greasy by the end of the day! With the salon product I could easily go two maybe three days without washing, with this product I can barely go one. It's irritating for me because I'm not sweating profusely or working out in any way. The only difference is this shampoo/conditioner. Also I've notice it's difficult to run my fingers through my hair, as well as to brush it, And I definitely have an increase of tangles and knots. Like others have mentioned, it must be product build up in the hair. The other let down is the  conditioner formula is really thin and barely feels like it moisturizes my hair at all, somehow it feels more stripped of moisture after using it in the shower. honestly had it not been for my Salon product experience I might not have never noticed but I'm glad I did!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;"Have used for a long time. Definitely helps hair look and feel more full. Not a new formula. There was an additional Biotin kind that OGX launched called ""Extra Strength"" or something, but this Thick and Full Biotin one looks to still be the same."
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I have thick wavy hair that is naturally very soft and manageable. This shampoo and conditioner made it impossible to brush through or do anything with, and it left a sticky residue. My hair was very dry but greasy at the roots, and my hair feels a lot thinner than when I started using it.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Got this because it seemed to have good ingredients. Biotin, collagen, vitamins, etc. Is sold as sulfate free but the third ingredient is a sulfate. I use this product like I've used others and after using this my scalp is always itching, I'm starting to get flakes, and normally I wash my hair 2 times a week but since using this, I can't be the day after washing my hair is insanely oily. Idk what the issue is with this company and their products but I've had the same problem when I used their keratin shampoo a few years ago.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This left a heavy film on my hair that made it feel nasty and unmanageable. My hair started falling out because of this. I threw this and the shampoo in the trash.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This shampoo and conditioner stripped my hair.  My hair is naturally dry, anyway, and it took 3 months to restore it (let is grow out). I keep my hair short.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I couldn't figure out why my hair felt so terrible the past few weeks. Usually, it is smooth and doesnt take much to detangle. I thought there was something wrong with me, until I realized I had recently started using this conditioner. I threw it out, used a Wella conditioner last night instead, and my hair is back to normal, although now I have breakage  due to how much I had to comb through knots in my hair because of this conditioner. Skip this one people, save your hair
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Used the OGX Thick and Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo for YEARS, and it made a huge difference to improve the thickness of my hair. But the ingredients are now different, and... just no. Not the same. In the history of cosmetics and hair products, I've only ever encountered 2 products that were truly improved when the ingredients changed. This was not one of those 2 products. I'm not looking forward to the annoyance of finding a new shampoo.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;i like that this shampoo is sulfate free, i don't think it did anything for thickness, and the fragrance is a bit too strong but smells nice
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Love the smell, love the feel afterwards, less frizzy and easier to manage. LOVE THIS!!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Replay I feel different when only one use
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Please use caution with this shampoo. I had used OGX brand products in the past (Argan Oil), and never had issues. However, about a week into using this shampoo and conditioner I noticed a large amount of hair fall and actually noticed several completely bald spots on my head. It made my hair extremely dry, tangled, and unmanageable. I know some people love it and have no issues, but I really wish I would have read more reviews before using. I'm now devastated and trying to grow my hair back.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I was excited to try this da shampoo and conditioner because I have had good experiences with other products from this brand, however I am not impressed with this one. It made my hair feel very waxy/greasy and dried my ends out quite a bit. I have fine hair strands, but thick hair overall. It weighed my hair down rather than adding volume. Might work for other hair types but not mine particularly.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Ever since I discovered this product shampoo and conditioner in my local supermarket, that's all I ever use now. I leave a tad bit conditioner in my hair for manageability after I wash my hair. My hair is so soft and full looking. I've gotten many compliments how healthy my hair looks. Great Product !! Thanks
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This conditioner is very thin and has barely any slip which made detangling my curly hair very hard, I gave it two stars because it did make my hair grow faster because of the biotin but it is very drying, as soon as I step out of the shower my hair feels silicone-e and it definitely made my hair frizzier.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This product is literally the best. My hair started falling a lot and I'm only 22 and I had no idea why. I started investing in all these hair shampoos for thinning hair like purador and Moroccan oil shampoo but they all made my hair fall in clumps. There was so much hair in the drain. My friend told me to buy the ogx biotin shampoo and conditioner and let me tell you, the results were amazing! After one use there was literally 2 strands of hair in the drain when I was done. And the best thing is you only need a drop. A little goes a long way. It definitely helped my itchy dry scalp and I can feel my hair getting thicker. YOU GUYS MUST TRY!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Beware- this will make your hair fall out in CLUMPS in the shower. Will never use again!!!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I swear by OGX conditioner. Even when I treat my hair with heat every day, this helps keep the split ends away. It's always surprising to my hair stylist how I have almost no split ends.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I used Nioxin for about 3 months. I did get compliments about my hair looking thicker but it left my hair extremely dry and frizzy. The first day after using this, I received the same compliments but also was told my hair looked healthier! Definitely using this instead, plus I'm saving a lot of money!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Looking for a new shampoo. Not much better than what I used already.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Was recommended by a friend but doesn't work for me. Needed to use another product to get the tangles out and moisturize
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I see a lot of people asking about what kind of scent this is all the time, and it states that it is a floral. Could be true, but I would compare it smelling to Aquolina pink sugar perfume, or sugar Scentsy bar. One of the reasons I use this shampoo, is for the awesome scent!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Not recommended for curly/course hair
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I wanted to give this product a try because I was loosing hair by the hand fulls and my hair is getting very thin. After just the first few uses I notice no lose of hair my hair was smooth and soft. The more I use it I'm noticing it getting frizzy but only loose a few strands vs a ton. I will continue to use this shampoo and conditioner.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I used this multiple times & was never able to fully wash it out ever. It leaves my hair with a waxy residue that makes it impossible to run my fingers through or brush easily. It is therefore prone to tangling and breaking. I normally have fine, smooth, and somewhat slippery hair & while this product gave the appearance of volume, it was simply product buildup making the strands appear thicker. Would not recommend, I am throwing out the remaining product.

Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Been buying this shampoo since summer. Keeps your hair full & moisturized. Smells great!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I have damaged hair due to bleaching it over 8yrs. I recently went brunette. I've been looking for a shampoo to help with my hair. My hair is damaged and feels frizzy and dry. After reading the reviews on here, I wanted to give it a try. Let me tell youC best thing ever! My hair was soft after getting out of the shower. I didn't even struggle to brush my hair. I totally recommend it if you have damaged hair. If it doesn't work out for you, you can always return it.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I use this shampoo every day.  It is the best I have used as far as keeping my hair stronger and healthier
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;And i used to use it a lot. But yeah if you just want your hair to smell delicious buy it.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I've received comments and noticed the thickness and shine
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;"Honestly, I had high hopes for this shampoo.  After using it, I noticed my head itching.  Then I started to feel bumps.  At first I thought ""maybe it's something else"", so I tried a different shampoo for a few days.  My scalp got better.  Went back to this shampoo/conditioner and the bumps are back and my head itches."
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;"""Dimethicone (which is in this product) is used as a sealant against water and even air. It is not a natural ingredient, and its side effects are bad for our hair. It gives the hair the illusion of shine, but it is not the shine we want—it is a fake shine from the plastic."" DO NOT BUY!"
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;my hair has grown so much since i started using this shampoo in the summer. 10 times out of 10 if my friends haven't seen me in two weeks they always comment on how my hair has gotten even longer since they've seen me! but also note my hair is healthy and i have rarely used heat in about a year. so not sure the effects on damaged hair
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I wash my hair 2-3 a week.  The crown of my head has noticeable breakage and this shampoo is helping alleviate that.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This hasn't really done anything for my hair. It's fine as a conditioner, but I dont think it's a great choice if you're trying to repair damage.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;My hair was falling in bulk really bad and I read this shampoo was good so I decided to give it a try and iam really happy with the results. I had 2 bald spots on my head and hair is starting to grow back again...
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I tried out the shampoo and conditioner as my sister had just bought it and the reviews seemed very promising but this DRIED MY HAIR OUT SO BAD! My hair has never felt or looked more dehydrated and frizzy. I will say they both smelled very nice and felt hydrating while I had used them in the shower but I did not like the way my hair dried at all. Very disappointed.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I want to love this shampoo simply because of the smell, but everytime i wash, it leaves my hair dull and greasy. I thought maybe it was just when I blow dried, but even after letting it air dry, it looked terrible. It always feels like the stuff isn't fully washed out every.single.time. It's so frustrating!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This is literally the worst conditioner I've ever used. It leaves so much build up on my hair, it makes me cringe. It feels like I didn't wash the conditioner out, and I stood in the shower EXTRA to make sure I got it all out. The reason people think that this gives them volume is because it just leaves build up on your hair! Avoid this product like the plague.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I used this in conjunction with the shampoo. I found that my hair looks thicker and fuller. conditioner makes my hair feel very soft and helps with tangles.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Does what it says. Leaves hair looking fuller and thicker.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Light weight and takes a small amount to use. Make my hair softer and easier to comb after washing my hair.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Inexpensive and works great
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;After just 3 to 4 washes I can tell the difference. I've used biometrix full density and OGX works 10x better
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;These shampoo and conditions are the best.  Safe for color treated and keratin treated hair.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Smells great! Leaves my hair soft & manageable.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I have two large drawerfuls of shampoo and conditioner. I'm always on the hunt for a shampoo that will tame my frizzy hair but not make it flat. This shampoo not only leaves my hair looking healthy but leaves my hair looking full and thick
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I have naturally straight, thin, fine hair and I have been using this shampoo for about a week now and my hair definitely feels fuller and thicker. I personally alternate every other wash using a normal shampoo because I don't want my hair to become too full and thick. Highly recommend for those with thin hair!!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Literally the best shampoo ever! I was experiencing serious fall outs, horrible! Was looking for a good shampoo and saw this on the shelf at Ulta. I have tried really expensive ones and never got the result I was looking for- promises of soft, shiny and etc. never happened with other ones. This biotin shampoo and conditioner not only leaves my hair sooo soft - living in humid Texas- but also has reduced the fall outs drastically. By drastically I mean if I was loosing 100 hair a day now it is like 10 a day. I hope it stays the same for my hair and scalp. I ordered two more of the big ones. Thanks for the great product. Hope it helps other people. Btw my hair is colored and my husband is also enjoying this shampoo and conditioner.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I have thin hair, and I love using the shampoo/conditioner combo because it leaves my hair looking thick.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Love the smell of this shampoo. Leaves my hair looking beautiful.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I really like this shampoo/conditioner combo. Great smell, keeps my hair tamed and voluminous. I am a biolage fiend but I couldnt justify the price for them anymore. For jumbo sizes OGX is affordable for my budget and even better durring the Jumbo Shampoo & Conditioner sale. I like using this and then blowdrying my hair after with their OGX thermal protector silk blowout cream.

Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Smells like literal heaven. I cannot stop smelling it. BUT after i wash my hair with it, i can't smell it on my hair hours later like i can with other shampoos which makes me sad.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I love this   Conditioner  It works so well it's great for fine hair
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I have tried matrix, kenra, and redken. You wont find anything else that will give you more volume than this one.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;The shampoo made my hair really soft, but the conditioner dried it out. Honestly used this and the shampoo for at least 2 or 3 months and saw no change in my hair.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I noticed a big difference with my hair after about 3 weeks of use.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I mixed this conditioner with olaplex and L'Oréal professional deep conditioner and I love the way my hair feels. My hair stylist even noticed my hair has been growing out. Definitely saw a change in hair growth more than I did with the biotin vitamins I was taking
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This shampoo (and the matching conditioner) do make my hair feel soft, and the smell is great. But after 3 months of scalp acne I've decided that I need to change to something else. I've never had that problem before, and didn't even know that it could be a problem until now.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I have long fine color treated hair. After using the conditioner for a couple weeks I noticed my hair in my brush about 2x the regular amount and every time I ran my hand through my hair, I would have 5-10 strands in my hand multiple times. DO NOT BUY THIS if you want to keep your hair. I did like how my hair felt silky and felt light but it's totally not worth it haha.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Ever since Ive been using this product people have been asking me if I got hair extensions. It makes my hair look soo full. I use it with the marula oil conditioner - great combination as it keeps my ends hydrated. I also have a sensitive scalp in which most shampoos cause flaking but this shampoo doesnt irritate. So thankful to have bought this. Originally bought in store but will now be purchasing online religously :D
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Have bought this product before....it's great for body
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;After 6 weeks of use, my hair is not thicker and I still have no volume. My hair is smooth, but I was looking for some volume.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I love this product! Definitely my new go to conditioner. I have not tried the shampoo yet, but after this I'm definitely going to!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Honestly i love it! i had really dry scalp and this helped so much i tried many shampoos and conditioners and none seemed to work for me except this one! It made my hair super silky soft!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I bought the shampoo and conditioner and LOVE THEM! I have fine, thinning hair. This really plumps up my hair, smells great, and doesn't leave my hair greasy after a few hours. Smells yummy too!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Almost seems like a miracle. My hair is gorgeous after one use. Soft, bouncy and full of life.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;good
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I bought this product in February after reading some good reviews. I wanted to grow my hair out and add volume to it. Though this product did help me grow my hair, it broke me out SO BAD the minute I started using it and no matter what I tried, the breakouts were too big and aggressive. I've finally decided to stop using it because the outcome is not worth it. I would not recommend this to anyone, as there are many other products that can help you grow your hair that won't break you out severely!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This shampoo does what it says and actually the first week I used it I got two compliments on how long and great my hair looked. However, it's  not worth the rash and scalp acne it caused. At first I thought I could manage a little hairline acne but now my scalp is completely irritated and my sideburns are full of acne. This has only happened to me once before (with Herbal Essences products) so I wouldn't say I have a sensitive scalp or anything, this is just really harsh I guess.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This and the matching conditioner get the job done. I've been using them for 3 months. However, I personally didn't notice any dramatic changes. I don't really see any extra volume or a thicker/fuller effect on my hair, like the shampoo claims. Overall, it is a nice shampoo but I won't repurchase.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Eh wouldn't buy it again.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I love this product. My braiding stylist used it once after I ran out of my normal conditioner and I've been hooked. That was about a year ago. I love the smell and the price. My hair is thick and kinky. I am a 4a/b hair texture. Yes, it detangles too and I am very tender headed so I am a fan!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Daughter's hair has never looked this good or been this easy to take care of
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This conditioner smells amazing. But that's about all the positive I have to say about this. It leaves residue in my hair and is causing some buildup. It's also super drying and causing my hair to be slightly unmanageable when trying to comb out afterwards. I will continue to use in small amounts along with a leave in conditioner that I now have to use to make my hair manageable but I will not repurchase.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This shampoo smells amazing. It lathers well and feels good in the shower. However, it doesn't do much for adding volume or thickness to my hair. And I think it's a bit drying. The matching conditioner doesn't do much for the dryness either. Will probably use until it's gone but won't repurchase.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This conditioner instantly gets out all tangles and knots in my curly hair no matter how many days old it is!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I purchased OGX because it came recommended by a hairstylist friend. I have somewhat oily, fine, wavy/straight hair. This shampoo/conditioner leaves my hair so dry and it feels like I didn't wash all of the product out every time. Not fan. Smells nice and the conditioned is nice and thick.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Great quality shampoo at a great price. Plus, it smells amazing!! My hair feels so clean after using this shampoo, yet it's gentle and doesn't dry my hair out. It actually feels stronger.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;gave this shampoo/conditioner a go but did not become a fan. It made my hair greasy by the second day, the smell was not pleasant and it made my hair fallout. i WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS SHAMPOO/CONDITIONER.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I have fine hair and volume/body is always a concern. I saw a noticeable difference within 2 uses! I love this shampoo!!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I gave this shampoo/conditioner combo a go, and I totally hate it! It leaves a thick, almost waxy feeling to my hair afterwards and it weighs it down so much. I thought maybe I was using too much product, so I used less, but even then it still left a very unpleasant feeling to my hair after my hair dries. Not to mention my hair looks like a grease ball by day 2! I won't be repurchasing.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I'm unsure if it's the shampoo, conditioner, or a combination of both, but this certain line of OGX leaves my hair with a waxy, weighed down feeling afterwards. I've tried using less product (thinking I was using too much) but even then it leaves a unpleasant feeling to my hair. Not a fan!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Every time I shampoo my hair
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I use this shampoo every other day with the matching conditioner and have told friends about it. I love the full thickness it gives my hair!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I love this shampoo (along with the matching conditioner). I noticed my hair was fuller after one use. Gives much better results than some expensive brands I've tried. Will buy again!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;We used this as our girls weekend out! And we all loved the smell and how it made our hair feel. We all have different types of hair.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;"This product is full of harmful sulfates that WILL dry your hair out. Depending on the individuals hair, they may notice right away (first use) or they may not notice until multiple or even several uses. But this WILL damage your hair. Having hair that ""APPEARS"" thicker is not worth the possibility of going bald. I mean the amount of reviewers with an experience of hair falling out is enough to make you not want to take the risk anyway. This shampoo did nothing for my hair back when I used it but make it extremely dry, brittle, itchy, tangled, etc. IF YOU WANT THICKER OR LONGER HAIR JUST TAKE ACTUAL BIOTIN VITAMINS. Try the rice water technique. Try using less heavy products. There are a ton of other ways that worked for me. This just wasn't one of them."
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This shampoo dried my hair out so much and didn't give me any volume at all. My hair has always been really dry and thick so maybe it would work better on thinner or oily hair.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;My hair was thinning out a lot and I was starting to get worried. I've been super stressed and also breastfed my daughter for a year. Immediately after using my hair felt, clean fuller and thicker. I was shocked! I also purchased conditioner. And would recommend using both. I used just shampoo one time without conditioner and it felt fluffy. I'm so happy I found this!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I have purchase this product and was excited to try it considering the great reviews I read, after the first wash it left my hair feeling silky, soft and smelling good. I even noticed the boost in volume. Shortly after less then 2 weeks of using this product my hair began to fall out in HUGE clumps and it left my hair greasy and dry and at the ends.. I would not recommend anyone buying this if you have dry or straight hair..
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I wash my hair every other day and the volume it gives is great
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Left my scalp dry and flaky and my hair oily
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This product (and even the brand) have been so hyped by people around me that I decided to try it this semester.  Upon reading some other comments here, I FINALLY figured out I'm not the only one struggling with this shampoo!  Before using this product, I had thick, wavy hair that I loved.  Sure I've changed lengths and cut my bangs 4 times here and there, but I've never dyed it and the texture has always been the same.  I've been using this shampoo consistently for 4 months waiting for my thick hair to come back.  I'm a nightshower-er, so I use this right before bed.  Twice a week, I've been conditioning with their coconut milk conditioner.  I've been waking up the morning after itching my head like I have a terrible case of lice (even though I have NO bugs in my head and don't see any dandruff), and I continue to feel the urge to itch it throughout the entire day.  My scalp has been ridiculously waxy and greasy all the time as well, and it's gotten to the point where dried shampoo can't even dry all that gunk out for a few hours while I'm in class or at work.  Plus, the whole bottom half of my locks are all dried up, so having my hair down closely resembles a wet rat.  I wear my hair up most of the time to cover it.  It feels so good to know I'm not alone, and I'll DEFINITELY be trying a new product ASAP.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;This shampoo lathers so well! My hair feels and smells super clean! And most importantly, my hair looks thicker and more healthy. I actually got lots of compliments on my hair after using it!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;I have 3b thin hair and I bought this product excitedly hoping it would give my hair the fullness i've always wanted but instead my hair ended up falling out in clumps :( didn't give the product 1 star because it probably works better on straight hair despite saying it works on any hair type and it smells really really good
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Don't use this product daily because it will ruin your hair. It will cause it to thin out. I have naturally thick hair and I used this product and my hair was ruined after continual use. Just don't use this product at all— there is much better out there!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo;Before I went natural I used to straighten my hair 24/7 every day and it broke off a chunk of hair unfortunately but this stuff fixed that and grew out my hair and made it more thicker!! I am now natural (3b curl type) and I still use this product and it still works just as good!!
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;Not heavy, not crunchy. Helps curls keep their shape while still remaining soft.
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;I love this stuff. A little goes a long way and it doesn't weigh my hair down. its hard for me to find products that don't weigh my hair down because my hair is quite long.  this one is a winner.
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;This is the best curl cream for my 3A/3B curls. It smells so good! Leaves my hair so soft and smooth and enhances my curls.
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;Excellent product!  Used it with the OGX Coconut shampoo.  My hair has lovely waves, body, and smells nice too. Very pleased with this purchased
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;Bottle pump to was broken. Disappointing. I love the product but package was damaged.
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;Hydrating for my curls, not heavy, doesn't make my blonde hair look dirty.
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;I didn't like this product it coats the hair and leaves it flat and I hardly put any on
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;Does not help with frizz at all and caused unusual amounts of build up
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;I have fine curls and this just weighs it down. Too heavy. Wish they would bring back the mousse
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;This smells great and made my wavy/curly hair soft, but I think I'd prefer something with a touch more hold. My curls kinda fell apart by the end of the day. Maybe a gel or something else over it would make it work for the whole day. I found that it worked well on both damp and dry hair.
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;wasn't terrible and kept my curls intact but i have really frizzy hair and needed to add oil to my hair anyway to help with the frizz :/
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;Love it! If you have long,dry, curly hair, you know what a mess it can be in the morning. This product  is great for detangling, de-frizzing, and making my morning leonine-looking hair actually looking pretty good!
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;I'm so happy to have found this product... I've been searching for years ... I have natural curls, but frizz became a problem when I started getting highlights. This product prevents the frizz but isn't oily or heavy ... I love it.
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;I have used OGX's Coconut Curls product line for several years.  At the time, I wanted styling products with a pleasant scent that would make my hair more manageable and less frizzy.  I loved using the curl milk with the shampoo, conditioner and hair butter because everything worked well together and smelled amazing.  A few months ago, I ordered a bottle of this product during one of Ulta's online sales.  OGX must have reformulated this because I immediately noticed that the smell was different and the cream was not quite as thick.  I compared the ingredients list on my old bottle to the new one and saw that there were some changes.  Instead of the coconut scent that I loved, the curl milk now has more of a citrus smell that I do not care for.  I ended up taking this back to the store and exchanged it for the Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream.  I still gave this product a three star rating because it is not that much different in terms of how it works, but I will no longer buy it because of the smell as well as the slight change in consistency.
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;you apply this product to damp hair (so not dripping) and i like to apply multiple times to my hair while it air drys. i bend over and apply from the end and work it towards the middle of the hair by pushing my curls towards my scalp to add bounciness to my curls!!
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;I've been using this for years! I have naturally wavy/ curly hair and this does a great job containing the curl. Also leaves my hair smooth and still easy to work with!
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;Leaves my current light and bouncy
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;Used to absolutely love and would make my curls look and feel amazing. Now it has a different smell and makes me breakout horribly along my hairline & I hardly get acne! It also just seems to not hold back my frizz the same way. Time to change hair products.
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;hair is crunchy in spots and frizzy in others
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;I bought this for my daughter who has amazing curls. Her hair looked so pretty after using this. Smells so good too
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;this styler was heavy for my super fine hair, weighed it down, looked and felt greasy, but smelled amazing and shaped my weak curl pattern hair decent enough but did not hold their shape through the whole day. could work for someone else with thicker hair and curlier curl type like 3c
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;Love how this smells! Mainly use as a refresher on second day hair and when my hair is 90-95% dry to give some softness and last minute definition (2A/2B curls). Use in unison with Not Your Mother's curl gel.
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;I purchased this to soften and manage my new hair after chemo and it works great
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;thought it would help curl but it doesn't
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;great product, excellent price and works for all!
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;Makes your curls touchable and soft. Not crunchy.
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;OGX Curling Milk is a fantastic product that works perfectly on my 2C-3A curls! I shampoo and condition using the OGX Quenching Coconut Curls shampoo & conditioner, which I don't rinse out all the way in order to leave some conditioning product while I comb. Then, I scrunch my hair using an old polyester T shirt, add the OGX Curling Milk, scrunch and air dry—-I get total perfection out of this routine. Plus, it smells incredible!
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;I use this product on freshly washed and detangled curly hair. After raking the product through I scrunch and blot dry with a t-shirt. If I leave it to air dry until 90-95% dry and finish with a hair dryer on cool it minimizes frizz and creates beautifully defined curls.
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;I usually wash my hair the night before I have to go to work and put my hair up in a silk scarf overnight. When I wake up, I put a small amount of this product and run it through my hair. It smells great, keeps my hair frizz free the entire day, and hold my curls without the crunchy feeling.
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;I had high hopes on this product but it didnt work at all. I have naturally curly (wavy to curly) hair and a good product really does the job of keeping curls defined usually. Regret buying this. Please don't waste your money!
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;This item is great and hydrating. Makes my curls feel wet and shiny and alive but.... it sucks for sleeping in. You wake up the next day and your head looks like a disaster. It makes my curls shrivel overnight and sucks. But if you use it in the morning and head right out it looks BOMB. hit or miss , up to you.
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;This stuff is amazing I truly love it
Quenching + Coconut Curls Frizz Defying Curl Styling Milk;It's easy you just put it in your hair wet to define your curls, and if you are fizzy just a little on the ends!
Bodifying + Fiber Full Big Hair Spray;It's a wonderful product it holds my hair all day and I have very fine thin hair
Bodifying + Fiber Full Big Hair Spray;This is the best hairspray for thin hair, hands down!  It makes my hair appear to be twice as big as it actually is, thanks to the (invisible) thickening fibers.  It is not sticky, smells nice, and is half the price of the more expensive hairsprays.  It has excellent hold, even during humid weather.  It took me a long time to discover this, and I am so thankful to finally find a hairspray that checks all of my boxes!
Bodifying + Fiber Full Big Hair Spray;For whatever reason I find this cap extremely difficult to take off... So I just leave mine off, kinda sucks for traveling. This hairspray really is not worth the price, but it does work. Nothing innovative.
Bodifying + Fiber Full Big Hair Spray;I have extremely frizzy hair, especially at my roots. But when I spray this at my roots and blow dry my hair it's incredible, no frizz all day or the days following that I don't wash. I also find my hair doesn't start getting greasy or start losing volume and shine as quickly as it usually does! Literally amazing and can't say enough good things, well worth every penny!
Bodifying + Fiber Full Big Hair Spray;This is the only hairspray! it keeps hair looking voluminous and lasts all day.  it is not sticky and still allows movement.  I just love this hairspray❤
Bodifying + Fiber Full Big Hair Spray;Great Hold
Bodifying + Fiber Full Big Hair Spray;This is my new favorite hairspray.  It holds your hair but is not sticky.  The best thing is the body it gives your hair.
Bodifying + Fiber Full Big Hair Spray;This really is a strong hold, long lasting hairspray. It has a really nice coconut smell. It will hold curls for all day easily, but it can be a little drying and heavy.
Bodifying + Fiber Full Big Hair Spray;This product works great !!
Bodifying + Fiber Full Big Hair Spray;I have little light hairs that fly away when I put my hair up, this holds them very nicely.
Bodifying + Fiber Full Big Hair Spray;Use it daily, adds great volume to fine hair
Bodifying + Fiber Full Big Hair Spray;A lot of hairsprays with a really strong hold look like my hair has a lot of hairspray on it. This one doesn't. It's also nice that it's not very expensive.
Bodifying + Fiber Full Big Hair Spray;This is a go to product for me now, my hair looks so full of volume even the day after, it also looks shiny! Smells great and doesn't stiffen hair too much.
Bodifying + Fiber Full Big Hair Spray;I have fine hair and no matter what I do, my style will always fall - even with hairspray.    I tried this, and it actually holds!   It smells great, and I don't have to worry about how my hair looks - or if my scalp is showing through because my style fell.
Bodifying + Fiber Full Big Hair Spray;If you want a strong hold, but don't want to pay an arm and a leg for it, this is your hairspray! It has a very strong hold and doesn't have a strong hairspray smell! Works as well as other more expensive brands, in my opinion!
Bodifying + Fiber Full Big Hair Spray;I love this product!!  I have very thin hair and have not found a hairspray that doesn't make my hair feel stiff and still hold, UNTIL NOW!!
Bodifying + Fiber Full Big Hair Spray;This is amazing it really adds volume to your hair. I flip my head over and spray I also lift my hair as I spray. This is my second time buying and I will buy it again!
Bodifying + Fiber Full Big Hair Spray;Great product. On my hair, it acts as a hairspray, texturizing spray, and volume spray all in one. I can also spray on dirty hair, rub in, and not need a dry shampoo. Strong, long lasting hold. It does make your hair crunchy if you spray too much in one area, but if you spray while moving at a regular distance, it's not a problem.
Bodifying + Fiber Full Big Hair Spray;The product smells nice but strong scented. The hair spray holds well but leaves a lot of residue and buildup makes hair almost instantly greasy.
Bodifying + Fiber Full Big Hair Spray;This hairspray really works on my hair. I have somewhat thin curly hair and I struggled with my hair going flat. I spray this on after using a curling cream, scrunch my hair while my head is upside down, and my hair actually looks full. This hairspray makes my hair look fuller and thicker. I have tried many products to achieve this look and I finally found one that works!
Bodifying + Fiber Full Big Hair Spray;I love this hairspray! I've tried everything from Big Sexy, Living Proof, Kenra and many more and this by far is the best! I can use a little for added volume or a lot for a great ponytail. I wish I would have tried this months ago!!!
Bodifying + Fiber Full Big Hair Spray;My hair loses volume quickly. This product makes it last.
Bodifying + Fiber Full Big Hair Spray;I love this hairspray. It is a firm hold so I use it when I need my curls to last all day.
Bodifying + Fiber Full Big Hair Spray;"As a 78 year old grandmother and recent great grandmother, I continue to ""keep up appearances"" as I firmly believe we all ""need a little help from products out there in the market"" to continue ""looking good""!"
Locking + Coconut Curls Finishing Mist;I liked the smell, and it provided a nice light hold. However, I only used 3 sprays on my long, fairly thick hair, and it was way too sticky for my liking- strands of my hair were stuck together and tangled like I had put glue in it.
Locking + Coconut Curls Finishing Mist;Love the smell ! Love the holding! Love how it's still soft hold! Just loved it!
Locking + Coconut Curls Finishing Mist;This product contains alcohol! It is stated on the the back in the ingredients. I have 3c-4b hair type and my hair was so dry. When i started to use the spray the smell of alcohol was intense and strong. I would NOT RECOMMEND!!
Locking + Coconut Curls Finishing Mist;I used this as a replacement for my other coconut oil mist but this is a horrible replacement. The second ingredient is alcohol and you can tell. The smell of alcohol is overpowering and I'm convinced that the spray does nothing to hydrate and actually does the opposite.
Locking + Coconut Curls Finishing Mist;I have bouncy, natural looking curls
Locking + Coconut Curls Finishing Mist;All products like these say they don't crunch but they always do, this one included. At this point, I don't really care, just as long as it works and this one does.
Locking + Coconut Curls Finishing Mist;Will definitely be buying again. I have not put a product in my hair for years due to sensitive skin and reactions around my hairline, but this one! Oh wow am I glad I tried it. This does EXACTLY what it says it does. My hair stayed naturally curly from use and did not flatten down at all. For my hair sometimes the humidity will cause my hair to weigh down the curls. This is a wonderful product!! Keeps hold, great for sensitive skin issues around hairline, and lasts all day!! Love it!
Locking + Coconut Curls Finishing Mist;I bought this to use as a hairspray.  It smells wonderful!  But dispensing is horrible.  The sprayer is hard to push, and when it does finally work, it comes out in a stream.  The trick is to keep pumping (if you can) and THEN it will come out in more of a spray.  It's absurd really.  The product does hold wonderfully and only left one part of my hair crunchy, and that was where it first dispensed in a stream.  I sprayed the product in my hands, and yeah, it's pretty darn sticky.  But it holds, so no issue with that.  I won't purchase again because if the sprayer.  I'll try to find another bottle to put it in for the time being.  The product itself IS good.
Locking + Coconut Curls Finishing Mist;"First, I love the smell.  Second, I did use this as a hairspray, and it has a very strong hold.  Third, it was hard to pump the sprayer, and when I got the hang of it, it shot out mostly in a stream in one spot, and of course, it left hard spots.  But it held!  LOL. There was a little ""spray"" but not very much.  I don't know...maybe I need to get a better feel for it before dismissing it totally."
Locking + Coconut Curls Finishing Mist;I guess I assumed it was just a curl enhance.  It is hairspray.   My hair was crunchy.   This product is fine if you want hairspray.  Not what I was looking for.
Locking + Coconut Curls Finishing Mist;Does very little to control frizz on my 2b/c curls. Also smells strongly of rubbing alcohol. It is lightweight, but just didn't work well for my hair
Locking + Coconut Curls Finishing Mist;I spray this in my hair after i shower, and just let it dry. By time i get to work my curls are defined and not frizzy at all! I've been looking for a product that will hold my natural curls without frizzing and weighing down my hair
Locking + Coconut Curls Finishing Mist;Love this spray mist! Made my hair wavy and gave it body. Just a little sticky. But most volumizers qee
Locking + Coconut Curls Finishing Mist;I love that I can put my hair in a pony then spray this and my curls stay in tact w no frizz. Smells great too.
Locking + Coconut Curls Finishing Mist;Love that this product doesn't make your fresh curls crunch, but still has amazing hold!
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;Worked well to prevent my hair from getting dirty but once my hair was already a little greasy it felt like this did nothing.
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;i have very oily hair and i can never go two days without washing it, so i purchased this dry shampoo to help me out. when applied, it didn't leave too much white residue, however, it added oiliness to my scalp and flattened my hair. i learned my lesson after 3 more attempts with it that this dry shampoo with added oils doesn't mix well with my already oily scalp haha. that said, it would probably do wonders for people who have drier or normal hair.
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;Alright product. Gets the job done. Does take quiet a bit sometime.
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;I love this! Smells amazing and makes my hair smooth and shiny!
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;I've tried half a dozen brands of dry shampoo ranging from $4 to 30, and the OGX works really well with no residue and a nice scent. I see no reason to switch away from this one, at least for my hair (which without dry shampoo looks greasy after just one day of no wash).
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;This is a great dry shampoo. Smells nice. Great price. Large bottle so it will last me awhile. Adds volume to my hair. Makes my 2 to 3 day hair look fresh.
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;Great scent- effective at absorbing oils and making hair feel fresh.
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;Dry shampoos make my head itch like crazy and my hair still looks gross after using. I use this weekly 1-2x and I keeps my hair fresh. it also smells good!
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;Nice shine and nice smell, unfortunately I had to use to much product for my thin oily hair.  Did not leave me with enough volume.  May be better for someone whose hair is not super oily or those not looking for volume.
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;Switched from Dove to this after noticing hair loss and thin patches (will never use Dove again). This product smells amazing, lasts for over 24 hours, and does not leave a white residue like most. Will be recommending to all of my girlfriends! Truly is nourishing and has softened my hair. I no longer feel excessive dryness. This product saved my hair.
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;This product works well, but can't get past the smell, I thought it might smell like coconut, but instead it's like body odor
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;Love how this absorbs oil and doesn't make my fine hair look gross. and it smells so good!
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;Good buy! Would definitely purchase again. It does leave a white residue on hair as most dry shampoos do. However, this one you can brush out/blend it into the root easily.
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;Favorite dry shampoo, only thing that seems to work on my super oily hair without breaking the bank!
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;As a working mom, this product is a life saver for my hair.
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;I love the way it smells and the texture it provides your hair without the build up!
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;I received this one, Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo along with the Argan oil of Morocco  one on the same order & somehow Coconut oil was already emptied. I am baffled by this!!
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;I have curly/wavy hair and this is my favorite dry shampoo. I live by Not Your Mothers toasted coconut texturizing dry shampoo, but this is my new favorite. It actually refreshes your hair without messing up your curls or leaving a white film. SMELLS AMAZING like coconut and vanilla
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;Smells and feels amazing... best dry shampoo hands down and super affordable.
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;Smells amazing and just feels amazing after applying to your hair. Even my boyfriend uses it now 🤣😅
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;So, I am usually someone who feels like I need to wash my hair everyday.  I feel like if I don't my hair feels oily, dirty and not clean.  I've tried many dry shampoos before that the smell was overbearing, giving me a headache later in the day.  When I use this dry shampoo, it smells great, light coconut smell that smells clean and isn't strong at all.  Which is good because who wants headaches from a dry shampoo?  Highly recommend this, so I can now to maximin 2 days without feeling the need to wash my hair.  And for me, that's huge...and saves me a ton of time!!
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;love love love..... This is my first time using dry shampoo. I see mixed reviews for this one, but I really like it. The scent is absolutely amazing! It gave me a nice lift and literally made my locks look like I had just washed and styled. I didn't experience any white stuff as previously mentioned, but I have medium to light colored hair. Will def buy again!
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;This is my first time using dry shampoo. I see mixed reviews for this one, but I really like it. The scent is absolutely amazing! It gave me a nice lift and literally made me locks look like I had just washed and styled. Will def buy again
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;The SMELL. Omg. 😍 I live for it. But also, the way it works is AMAZING. I've been using the coconut not your mothers for about 2 years and decided to switch things up. I tried so many different ones just because, until I finally landed on this one. No white cast, no strange feel in your hair, wonderful scent and super flexible and texturizing! Love!!
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;I tried spraying far from the hair and still it turned my hair white also doesn't do its job. would never buy again
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;Smells great & works, but it's one of the tougher ones to rub in/never quite disappears
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;I have thin hair that I color copper. This does not leave that weird white cast in my hair. Sucks up all the oil, and smells great. I have oily skin and scalp and get greasy the next day after washing. This stuff helps me go 3-4 days without washing. I love it so much more than even the expensive brands.
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;I have very fine, thin hair and not a ton of it. Usually dry shampoos make my hair even greasier making them pointless. This is the only dry shampoo that worked for my hair type (including high end brands). If you have thin hair that gets greasy, I definitely recommend trying this one! I've also tried other dry shampoos from this brand, but this one was the only one that really worked for me.
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;I bought this to try because I've never really used dry shampoo. This was the perfect price and size to give it a go. The spray smells amazing and got rid of that oily look on my no wash hair days.
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;Leaves white specks behind after spray & brush out
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;The smell is great and probably the only dry shampoo I'll ever use to be honest.
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;Great dry shampoo ! Does not leave white residue
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;I use this dry shampoo in between my hair washing days. I also have a travel size for my gym bag for a quick refresh. The scent is my favorite. I separate the top of my hair and spray sections. This absorbs oil quickly. You only need a little or it could make your hair stiff and the scent might be overwhelming.
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;I have chin length dirty blond, fine, thick hair and wanted to use this to refresh the previous days blow out. This just coated my hair and didn't give any lift whatsoever. My roots were still oily and my hair was gray matte. A waste.
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;I use this at least 3-4 days a week. It's amazing!!!!!
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;I kept this bottle for a while as a back-up for batiste. I've used it probably 10 times and I hate it every single time. It does not work at all. I haven't had a problem with my hair being noticeably oily in over a year, but when i spray this to try to add volume or fix some oiliness, it makes it a million times worse. i don't feel very strongly about too many hair products, but this is the worst.
Extra Strength Refresh & Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo 5oz;Best dry shampoo ever !! Works so well on oily hair and flattened out my roots. Very easy to work with! Have purchased 2 bottles:)
Flexible Aspen Extract Texture Dry Texturizing Spray;Yes love it & very upset it is being discontinued!!!
Flexible Aspen Extract Texture Dry Texturizing Spray;So this really didn't give me hardly any texture. But what's worse! Is that it is hard to get out of your hair and clumps together! Even after washing! Not impressed.
Flexible Aspen Extract Texture Dry Texturizing Spray;This product doesn't add texture and body. It works like hairspray and is too stiff on the hair. I wanted texture, not another hairspray. Not worth the price.
Flexible Aspen Extract Texture Dry Texturizing Spray;I really wanted to like this as the my other 2 favorite texture sprays are over $20 each so this would be more affordable if it worked. This sprays hard and fast, but I am used to that with my other 2 favs, HOWEVER, the other 2 spray a truly dry spray and pump up the hair where it lands with texture and body. This just sprays wet and tacky/stiff and actually weighs my hair down in the end. My hair looks like a nest that I end up having to redo.  My bathroom fills with a white, cloudy residue too, like leaves me gagging. So much that I have to turn on the exhaust to blow it up and out. I might return and just pay for what I know works on my fine, blonde, shoulder length hair.  (Fekkai and Triplesec are the bombs).
Flexible Aspen Extract Texture Dry Texturizing Spray;I was super excited to get this and tried it as soon as I got home. Snagged the last one on the shelf! Can't speak to the longevity of the hold but it's definitely strong and it took a basic pony tail from meh to effortlessly wispy and chic. I have lots of fine but super curly hair that gets thin and silky when I straighten it, and this product is everything I need to bring the body back. I absolutely love it and can't wait to try it on wand curls and other styles. Also, it smells like the beach. And not a fake sunscreen and coconut scent, but like the actual beach. Amazing!
Flexible Aspen Extract Texture Dry Texturizing Spray;It sprays so hard it messes up my style. Not a strong hold. Smells good is about the only pro I can say about it.
Flexible Aspen Extract Texture Dry Texturizing Spray;Like the smell does the job
Flexible Aspen Extract Texture Dry Texturizing Spray;It's a great styling product
Flexible Aspen Extract Texture Dry Texturizing Spray;This is one of my only repeat buys at Ulta . This is by far the best texture sprays I've come across and I've tried a tonnnnnn. It smells really good and it doesn't leave a nasty residue. 10/10 for sure
Flexible Aspen Extract Texture Dry Texturizing Spray;I always curl my hair and give myself beachy waves. I spray this in my hair when I'm done, and it gives me that messy look I want :) it also smells great. I'll buy this again
Flexible Aspen Extract Texture Dry Texturizing Spray;TOTALLY COMPARABLE TO ORIBE DRY TEXTURE SPRAY THAT IS OUTRAGIOUSLY EXPENSIVE BUT I DO SPLURGE ONCE IN A WHILE ON IT... IM SO HAPPY I FOUND THIS PRODUCT!!!!
Flexible Aspen Extract Texture Dry Texturizing Spray;For added texture and fun!
Flexible Aspen Extract Texture Dry Texturizing Spray;The day after hair washing perk up with out the heavy feel of dry shampoo.
Flexible Aspen Extract Texture Dry Texturizing Spray;This is my favorite spray to use when styling my hair. I LOVE the smell. Also gives great hold without hair feeling stiff. I just hope they don't stop carrying this because it is becoming more difficult to find in stores.
Flexible Aspen Extract Texture Dry Texturizing Spray;Smells fantastic and gives great hold without being stiff! I use this everyday.
Flexible Aspen Extract Texture Dry Texturizing Spray;This is one of my favorite texturizing sprays ive tried. It not only smells amazing but it helps keep my hair tamed.
Flexible Aspen Extract Texture Dry Texturizing Spray;"This is one of the only texture sprays I find myself running back to rebuy. I get so many compliments on my hair whenever I use this spray. It smells amazing as well. This is not a dry shampoo and yet I find it helping my hair last those few extra days on top of making my hair look thick and ""messy"" . Buy this buy this buy this"
Flexible Aspen Extract Texture Dry Texturizing Spray;I love using this after I curl my hair! It lasts and doesn't make my hair crunchy or greasy. I've used the Oribe dry texturizing spray, and this is a pretty good dupe.
Flexible Aspen Extract Texture Dry Texturizing Spray;Bought this to add texture to my very soft hair...It did nothing!  On top of the that, the sprayer sprays in an upward motion...not directly into the hair and roots where I tried to apply it.  Worse part is I two containers of the stuff.
Flexible Aspen Extract Texture Dry Texturizing Spray;Gives an effortless look to my lob when styling. It's afforadble too.
Flexible Aspen Extract Texture Dry Texturizing Spray;I tried several expensive texture sprays but they always gunked up my hair. This stuff is dry, but it gives great volume. I bought out the store!
Flexible Aspen Extract Texture Dry Texturizing Spray;I wanted to like this. To get any kind of texture you have to use a TON!. Half the time it feels like it is just blowing air. The pressure is much too strong and blows your style everywhere. Will not purchase again.
Flexible Aspen Extract Texture Dry Texturizing Spray;I recently got a drastic hair cut and needed new products for my short hair. This spray smells great, gives a nice tousled yet put-together texture, and is even volumizing!
Flexible Aspen Extract Texture Dry Texturizing Spray;Terrific texturizer for fine, thin hair like mine.  Does not weigh hair down, not sticky, gooey, or greasy.  No stiffness, either.  And it smells delicious!
Flexible Aspen Extract Texture Dry Texturizing Spray;Absolutely love this product!  Not only does it add the much needed volume to my hair, it smells amazing!! I hope they continue to make it. I absolutely love and recommend it!!
Flexible Aspen Extract Texture Dry Texturizing Spray;I have fine hair, and I have tried most of the texture sprays that exist. This is a true dry texture but it actually is comparable to high end! Tends to last for me and I've been using for a few weeks time - will build up over the course of a few days if you over apply. Give this a shot!
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;I purchase this item for my husband and I haven't heard any complaints so that is a good thing. I occasionally use it and I love the tingly sensation on my scalp whenever I use it.
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;I Love using this Tea tree mint shampoo so much and it makes my hair feel so good.
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;This shampoo deeply cleans my oily scalp and keeps oil at bay all day. I also enjoy that it doesn't flatten the roots of my hair and makes my hair fluffy and more voluminous. Unfortunately over time, I feel that it dried out the ends of my hair. It also tangles my hair more after I get out of the shower. When I go to brush my hair, it is more difficult and I feel now that I have more breakage and split ends. I've also noticed more shedding than usual. I tried using more gentle brushes and other moisturizing treatments to compensate, but to no avail. I have a fuller head of finely textured strands. This would probably work best for someone with thicker strands.
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;One of my least favorite tea tree mint shampoos I've ever used. It did not stimulate my scalp and did not feel as much of the cooling effect as with others. My hair also didn't feel as cleansed.
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;This is the second shampoo I've found that works to keep my hair not oily the day after showering that's also safe for color treated hair. It also smells really good and leaves you feeling fresh.
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;This shampoo felt very nice when I was in the shower. Tingly, clean, fresh. But when I woke up the next day, my scalp was so itchy, I went to the mirror and there were visible flakes so large and just so irritated. I also tested it and waited for the second day to see if the dryness dulled down, and it didn't. Actually, it made my second day hair an absolute oil slick and I have such thick, full hair. second day hair is usually not oily, not until the 4th day. This shampoo made my condition worse and I will not use again.
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;Don't buy it. Save the money!!!
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;This is the best shampoo I've found that keeps dandruff/ itchy scalp at bay without making my hair feel like straw. It's lightweight and hydrating, without contributing to/ exacerbating my oily scalp.
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;Felt super clean
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;I used this shampoo for a solid month and every week led to more and more hair loss. It started out as light shedding, and then clumps of hair started coming out. I've NEVER had any issues with my hair before. But after using it, besides my hair coming out, it caused my scalp to become sensitive, caused scabbing and ultimately made my hair super brittle. I haven't used this shampoo in about 2weeks and my scalp feels waaay better and the shedding has calmed down significantly. I DO NOT RECOMMEND.
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;I love this product! Every few months, I get an extremely dry and itchy scalp that drives me crazy. I use this product for a few days and the problem is gone. It smells soooo good (if you like smell of tea tree oil and mint), and the cooling sensation feels great. I always recommend this product to friends who have itchy scalps as well.
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;I have used Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo in the past but since stopped using it. Due to dry scalp and product buildup, I tried this shampoo and it worked WONDERS. I was genuinely shocked by not only the softness of my hair but how much it cleaned my scalp and soothed itchiness. I will definitely be using this again and would recommend it to anyone struggling with dry scalp and buildup. Give it a try!
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;This shampoo falls in the middle of the tea tree spectrum for me (Paul mitchell is the highest, Hask is the lowest). I wanted a shampoo that made me feel very clean and the aromatherapy aspect is an added bonus after a long day of work in healthcare. I haven't had luck with corresponding tea tree conditioners in the past so I paired this with the ogx coconut miracle oil conditioner. My scalp wasn't dry nor was it oily even after daily washes. I'd repurchase!
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;Do not like at all, it is supposed to be for oily hair, but it made my hair oilier.
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;This is amazing shampoo. It is fairly priced and even though I am a guy, it makes my hair so soft - unlike anything I have ever used. Smells great also! Great stuff!
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;i love this shampoo, i have a very oily and sensitive scalp so i have to be very cautious with the shampoos i use. it's not harsh, so it won't cause frizziness which is sometimes a problem for me when testing new shampoos. it also feels great on the scalp + no sulfates! which is great for me personally.
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;My hair is flat and very oily no life to it..I've tried multiple shampoos ..after one use my scalp felt rejuniated and my strands looks x3 thicker . Works better then the L'Oréal keratiquse I spent $50 on!
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;I have really thick oily hair and I was looking for a shampoo without sulfates to use over the summer without being overly stripping because I do a lot of swimming in chlorine. This shampoo works really well at deep cleaning my scalp to remove oil without being overly striping, but I do need to use a lot of shampoo per wash.
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;I have really oily hair so much that I have to wash my hair everyday bc it's disgusting how much oil I produce. I also suffer from dandruff. I bought this shampoo in hopes that it would help me not have to wash my hair everyday. Sadly this if anything made my hair even worse. I feel like after using this my hair produced EVEN MORE oil and my dandruff got worse. :( Don't recommend at all. It's a REALLY drying shampoo so i think what happened is it stripped all my natural oils causing my hair to produce even more oils than before. The only thing I liked is the smell of the shampoo.
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;Smells amazing and definitely helps with a dry scalp!
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;I got this on a whim and I'm a huge fan ! It has that fresh minty smell and gives my hair that amazing clean feel.
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;My husband has oily hair, this shampoo works very well for him
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;smells amazing
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;I use this to help treat my gross dandruff. It cleans it completely but can feel drying, after I use it I use AllSoft from Redken root to top & afterwards detangle with Redken 25 benefits  spray, chi silk infusion, and Kenra blow dry spray, this cocktail has my hair perfect for at least a couple days.
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;"I've had a irritated, sensitive scalp for a long time, but this product works wonders. It is extremely soothing and gets rid of any irritation or blemishes I get. I have fine curly hair that can get dry, but, despite it being ""extra strength,""  I'm able to use this every time I wash my hair (every other day) unlike a clarifying shampoo."
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;Wow, my scalp doesn't itch! Move over Head and Shoulders! Outta my way T-Gel! There's a new shampoo in town! And my hair is fabulous now! 🌈🙌🏻
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;i keep trying to like this but it just doesn't clean my hair! every time i use this, my hair still feels dirty. don't bother on this one.
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;I tried this while staying at my daughter's house. The smell sold me and I purchased my own at my first opportunity.
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;I have had painfully dry and flakey scalp issues. Dandruff was my worst enemy and this product has ended the constant search for remedies. I tried vinegar and water solutions for at home treatments, other shampoos which helped my hair...but not my scalp. And this product smells amazing, and left my hair with more volume, defined frizzy waves into small curls, and left little to no dandruff after my first wash! Absolutely recommend giving it a try if you have dandruff or dry scalp issues.
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;I love using this version of OGX tea tree shampoo. It always gets the job done for me. It washes out any buildup of dry shampoo and leaves my hair feeling fresh and clean. The smell is good too because of the mint. I go a few days in between washes since my hair doesn't get greasy easily (I've got thick, wavy, dyed hair). A little goes a long way but I do wish they sold this in a bigger bottle.
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;I love this product everything it says on the bottle is true! You get a fresh tingle !! And it's amazing instant shine and smells so good too!!! My boyfriend used it and actually wanted mine so I had to go back and get some more!! Lol
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;Daily use.
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;I have a dry scalp + dandruff and this shampoo eliminated that. The smell is strong, but I actually like it! It makes me feel so nice with a fresh scalp and I would highly recommend this
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;This is a great shampoo to Help contain moisture for your hair
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;I have always struggled with oily and thin hair. So, after trying this it adds a little bit more volume in my hair and I can even go another day without washing my hair because it doesn't get oily as quick as it usually does! The smell is strong and kinda stinks in my opinion but not to the point that I won't use it. Also, the shampoo has gel like feeling when coming out of the bottle which kind of freaked me out at first!
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;"Bought for my husband to use.  He loves it!  He is balding and has ""flaky"" scalp problems"
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;I bought this item, because the Ulta near me did not have the Eucalyptus Mint Shampoo in stock. I figured since this shampoo was also supposed to help with scalp heath, I would give it try. My hair has been getting oily faster, and the shampoo has not helped my dry, itchy scalp at all.
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;I've spent years trying to find a shampoo that works for my oily hair. This is it
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;"I got BAD dandruff, like to the point I considered going to the doctor. I saw this at ulta and thought ""what could it hurt"" so I tried it. My first thoughts were it smelt like toothpaste but let me tell you, IT HAS HELPED MY SCALP SO MUCH.slowly getting rid of my dandruff."
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;Absolute loved how it cleaned my hair and the smell is wonderful.
TEATREE MINT XS SHAMPOO;My boyfriends dandruff is so much better and his head doesn't itch anywhere near as much! It did not take it away completely but it has been the best thing we've tried so far!
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR YEARS!! It has made my hair so beautiful and healthy. It also smells amazing. I struggle to find this product on a regular basis because its always sold out almost everywhere! It is worth every single penny!
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;this alongside the ogx coconut milk shampoo and conditioner saved my destroyed hair! i just jumped on the haircare train and i do not regret it. my hair was crispy, dry and damaged and this just added shine, moisture and overall health. a new holy grail.
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;I've been using this serum for almost a year now and I absolutely love it! I have thin, dry, mostly straight hair, and I use this on it before styling. I can use it on wet or dry hair and it increases shine, reduces frizz, and helps it stay straight throughout the day. My holy grail serum!
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;I bleach my hair a lot & I started using this on my dead ends, it gives lots of moisture and takes away a lot of frizz & dryness! I wouldn't recommend putting your head against things if you don't want them oily other than that it's perfect. 10/10 for hair
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;my hair has been bleached and is dyed and it's just unhealthy looking and feeling. Most serums i have bought were too sticky and an icky feel on my hair. But this one is not. I towel dried my hair to where it's damp and i pumped the serum to by hands and then applied to my hair and combed through , i let my hair dry on it's own and usually it get frizzy but it wasn't , it was very soft and looked way better. (My hair is thin and straight)
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;I've never had a hair serum before and I love this! It only takes a small amount because a little goes a long way!! I haven't taken it long enough to tell if it prevents breakage but it makes my hair so shiny and soft!! And it smells so good too!
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;This has been a miracle for me. I struggled with split ends for awhile and I felt like my hair grew very slow, so o didn't like getting it cut. This stuff helped me with my split ends and it seemed like my hair grew faster. I
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;I love this oil because my hair gets really frizzy at times so I wanted an oil to keep it shiny but not too greasy. It's been lasting me a long time and it was super adorable. Highly recommend
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;I used this almost every time I showered until it broke. I tried to fix the lid but it would not go on. Throughout my time having it i noticed that it was quite messy and oil would spill out and make the sides sticky. Impossible to travel with. I really loved the formula but I haven't brought myself to purchase it again.
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;Leaves my hair feeling nourished. A little bit goes a long way and lasts forever
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;Great price,  expensive results! This is a must for blondie's who bleach.
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;This item came with the top haphazardly screwed on and the product leaked out all inside the package envelope. I had previously purchased this with many other items and they forgot to put it in the package. I tried to be patient as it took another week to arrive but they give me this... such a joke.
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;My hair has been frizzy for as long as I can remember, but this serum has done wonders! My hair looks so much healthier and more moisturized when I use this.
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;I absolutely adore this serum. I recently have been growing my hair out for the past 2 years and it finally was at a length that I decided to start dying it. With bleaching my hair I'm afraid of it breaking but not with this product! This product makes my hair feel revived it feels softer and stronger, helps to keep my hair from being a frizzy mess, and adds great shine. I always admire and can tell a difference in my hair when I use this serum. 100% recommend to everyone.
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;makes my hair look greasy after a few hours..
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;This is a must-have hair product for me! I've had terrible breakage for years, but this serum really really helps! I can feel the difference and it smells wonderful to!
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;This is one of my favorite products, but I am very disappointed because the products that were shipped too me came in a bag and 2/6 came perfectly fine but the rest were all spilled and one was broken so my package came in so messy! I wonder if I am able to return them?
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;I've been using this product for a little over two weeks now and LOVE it! It smells amazing and makes my hair so soft and manageable! I use one full pump for my whole head after showering. I use it as a detangler too, and comb it through my towel dried hair. I let my hair dry overnight and it's sooo soft in the morning! I bleach my hair every 8 weeks and this has been a god send to help repair my dry damaged hair!
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;Smells great and left my hair looking softer, shinier and healthier. The only thing is is that a little goes a long way with this product and you only need one pump per each side of hair. If you use even just a little more than one pump it can leave your hair greasy. Make sure you evenly distribute it through your hair!
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;I Recently Purchased This And Like It So Far. Helped With Frizzy, Damaged Ends And Reduced Some Of Frizz. Not Oily Or Sticky So That's A PLUS! Still Testing It Out!
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;I personally like to use this oil on my ends after I blow dry my hair, it's makes the tropical coconut smell more fragrant:)
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;I've been using this oil since I was in first grade, literally not kidding. I'm 16 now. It smells so nice and whenever I wear it people tell me my hair looks and feels very healthy. It's not for everyone I know, as it's a kinda thick oil. I have natural thick hair, and I use this when I flat iron or curl my hair. Definitely worth a try, and works well with other products too! :)
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;I've been using this product for years. I have dry, chemically treated, fine hair. I put it on wet and it gives it moisture and shine. I absolutely love this product
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;I absolutely love this product! I was really leery because I have fine/oily hair, so putting an oil on it didn't seem like the best idea. I have been using the same hair products for years now, so when my hair started to become really frazzled and dry I wasn't sure why. Well, I decided to swap out my normal leave in (Biosilk) with this product and I am in LOVE! Since it is an oil base, I really just focused on the ends and then ran whatever was left on my fingers through my scalp/middle. Also, a little goes a long way. All my fly aways are tamed, my ends feel great, hair feels soft and looks beautifully shiny! Highly recommend this product.
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;This is honestly the worst hair oil I've ever used. I already have pretty oily hair but I blow dry it so I like to add a little oil in the ends(like their argan weightless dry oil). But this one did not soak into my hair at all. It just left a gross oily greasy feeling to it and I had to wash my hair again the next day. It doesn't even soak in after a day. Granted I have very fine hair so maybe that's the problem but I do not recommend this product if you have hair like mine
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;love it. recommend it.
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;I use this product on my hair and it smells amazing, it made my hair so soft. I literally got compliments on the smell and how soft my hair looked.
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;smells great and makes my hair feel soft and smooth. i'd recommend this to anyone with frizzy/wavy hair that uses heat on a regular basis. it does a great job of adding moisture back into my hair
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;After bleaching my hair, it became dry and frizzy. I bought this and I can tell the difference. I apply some on damp hair and it feels so good. It smells yummy too. This serum is not oily for my hair and I love it.
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;"Honestly I got this product to use in paint to create ""cells"" for my artwork"
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;My hair became dry and brittle after a use of steroids....I'm SO happy I found this, talk about an instant fix.
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;I use it everyday
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;Great for thick, coarse, dry hair - works on wet or dry! Since it has silicone, I use a leave-in without silicone first, then use this. I've been using this every day since I discovered it over 5 years ago (I think).
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;My hair was brittle and dry.  This made my hair shiny and soft.  It improved the feel and look immensely.  I started using it on my eyebrows and eyelashes and feel like they also look better after a short time.
COCONUT MILK ANTI-BREAKAGE SERUM;I washed my hair and then I just brushed it out and ran my fingers through my hair with the product on my hands.
Blonde Enhance + Purple Toning Shampoo;"My hair stylist recommended I use a purple shampoo to time down the blonde brassiness in my grey hair. I chose this because it said ""Toner"" on it. I put it on my dry hair for about 20 minutes. Not only did it take out the blonde but it made my grey such a gorgeous white color!!! It's soft and silky and I absolutely love it. I will be using it from now on."
Blonde Enhance + Purple Toning Shampoo;This really isn't doing much in terms of toning. I left it on for about 5 minutes and it barely toned at all. Maybe this is more of an every day use purple shampoo vs the more expensive brands that really get the job done.
Blonde Enhance + Purple Toning Shampoo;I used this right after my wedding me and my husband went to beach spend two nights in hotel I used it and he gave me compliments he said he loves my hair color it looks more gold and it's silky smooth I am so happy my husband compliment me thank Jesus 😍🥰🍀😇🙏🏻😍🥰🍀😇🙏🏻😍🥰🍀😇🙏🏻😍🥰🍀😇🙏🏻😍🥰🍀😇🙏🏻😍🥰🍀😇🙏🏻😍🥰🍀😇🙏🏻😍🥰🍀😇🙏🏻 Holy blessings and positive vibes
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;i been using this brand for a year and has my hair so soft and great. love the smell.
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;The scent is way to strong and artificial. Also it takes a lot of effort to make it lather up. Gave me dandruff too.
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;Smells great, made my hair feel healthy, but it made my hair fall out in clumps.
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;Ever since I started using this my hair feels so soft and silky! My hair is very thin and brittle, I have a lot of split ends but since I started to use this I have definitely seen an improvement and my hair definitely looks a lot shiner and healthier than before.
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;Smells great but it made my hair very dry after using it.  Wouldn't use this everyday
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;This product did not wow me at all. I really hoped that my hair would feel more hydrated and restored but it falls flat for me. No nice lather and my hair feels frizzy and not hydrated. Also it smells like playdough.
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;Ive used this conditioner before and never had a problem now its making me break out all over my face and neck. The product is unusable.
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;I have thin, fine and dry/damaged hair and I thought this product would bring some moisture back into my hair but I was wrong. The conditioner does absolutely nothing to my hair, might even make it worse. After combing it through my wet hair in the shower and letting it sit for a few minutes you'd think when washing it out my hair would be smooth and moisturized but it's the complete opposite. I can't even get through the knots and have so much trouble brushing after I get out of the shower. I never write reviews but I just couldn't believe this was rated so highly bc it SUCKS
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;My hair was extremely damaged. I tried this shampoo and conditioner and my hair is healthy now! I've been using this for a few months and my hair couldn't be better.
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;The smell was great. After my first attempt to use it, my hair was still very knotty. On my second attempt, I used a lot more and left it on longer. Once again, my hair was left knotty and almost felt like it had a coating on it once it was dry.
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;This product is amazing!!! I used it on a whim after I had fried my hair with bleach. It was in horrible condition breaking off, hard to brush/comb, falling out and the ends were horribly damaged. After using the shampoo and conditioner for a few weeks, my hair came back to life!!! It also smells really good. I now use it regularly since I often color and use heat products and my hair looks shiny and healthy!!!
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;This is the worst shampoo. You will get a lot of dandruff after using this shampoo and your hair will feel really dry.
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;i'd give the shampoo a 6.5/10 it smelled very good, but it was a bit drying to my hair. I have very thick 3c curly hair. the conditioner would be an 10/10 it smelled amazing, even better then the shampoo and it was so moisturizing. I detangled my hair in half the time. I recommended for curly hair.
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;I have blonde color treated hair and this actually moisturizers my damaged strands and I LOVE the smell
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;After a few consistent professional hair colorings, my 3a/b curly hair was dull, lifeless, and a huge frizzy ball— my curl was nearly nonexistent. Within 3 uses of Coconut miracle oil shampoo, conditioner, and penetrating oil, I noticed a difference. My hair is silky, my curls are coming back, and it is SO much easier to brush through. I highly recommend!
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;I bought both the shampoo and the conditioner and they work great together but I would also recommend using the tea tree oil and mint shampoo with the conditioner. Both products from this set are really good if you are trying to hold out on getting a trim. Super hydrating and made my hair feel soft and shiny. The one complaint is that after awhile it's almost like it stopped keeping my hair soft and smooth. It was good for the first couple of months though and the tea tree oil shampoo with this conditioner helped my hair grown 1 inch a month!
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;Not the best not the worst hair feels good just as the shampoo which is also good would it buy agin no but I will continue to use
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;I ordered this shampoo based on the reviews. I have long hair that goes almost down to my waist and the ends were split ends and dry and felt damaged. After one use with this shampoo my hair felt healthy and revitalized. Not only that it smells great!! I didn't have to use near as much as with drugstore brands such as Pantene and others to be able to cover all my hair and make it feel clean!
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;I expected more from this conditioner.  I thought it would be super moisturizing because of how moisturizing the shampoo was, but I was wrong.
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;It's smooth and smells great.
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;love this brand
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;I've spent almost two decades searching for the best products for my thick, curly hair. It's usually on the dry side and I dye it a few times a year. This conditioner is really and truly a miracle!! My hair has never been softer, lighter, and more manageable than it is now with this. It even helps keep my hair from tangling for a few days after. I couple this with a lightweight curl defining mousse (OGX or Frizz Ease, every other brand I have tried left my curls crunchy and heavy) after my shower and I can rock my natural look without frizz until I wash it again. I recommend mixing a dollop of the conditioner in a spray bottle with water to use for morning touch ups. It smells incredible and keeps my hair under control. Some people said it left residue but it never has with my curls.
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner out there!! It helps with my frizzyness, helps with the softness, and overall leaves my hair looking healthier with each use! The shampoo is a little light, but other than that they're great products!! (Talking about shampoo and conditioner!)
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;I used this shampoo and conditioner and it made my hair very oily. My scalp does tend to be on the oily side, and I had it under control with my previous products but I wanted to try something new and read that this helps with hair growth. I tried it for a couple of weeks because I only shampoo every few days. It just didn't work for me. Made my hair very greasy looking. It will probably work well if you have very dry/damaged hair.
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;Newer formula is less nourishing as it contains more chemicals and less coconut oil, which I suspect is where the old almond scent is originating from. It also leaves hair unmanageable, feeling like straw. After years of using OGX, I now have to find another brand.
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;Love this product
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;I have PCOS and went off my birth control for 2 months and my hair started thinning pretty bad. I'm caucasian and always had thick, long, healthy hair. It was heartbreaking. I tried many products that didn't help or made the fallout worse. I've been using this for about 2 weeks now and I'm beyond grateful for it. My hair looks and feels healthy again. I think it's starting to grow back and I barely lose any hair in the shower now, maybe just 2-3 strands. My dry, sensitive scalp really likes this too. I actually used this shampoo and conditioner back when my hair was at its thickest and longest 2 years ago. After my hunt for something to help with my hair loss, I finally remembered this shampoo and conditioner and how healthy my hair was when I used it in the past. I will always go back to this.
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;The crown of my head has noticeable hair breakage and this conditioner is helping greatly so far.
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;i try alot of shampoos and conditioners, but i always come back to this one. great for sensitive scalps as well.
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;I was shopping for a new hair shampoo/conditioner duo for my thick,curly and frizzy hair. I was looking for something that would eliminate mid day frizz and puffiness and provide the long lasting freshly styled look I was aiming for. Budget is always a factor so that was a huge plus in my decision making while comparing products. My hair needs an extra moisture boost during this time of year in northern MI. The frigid, dry air does not play well with my hair. With all that being said, another factor in my decision was previous reviews. The majority of reviews I read had more pros than cons and overall seemed like a popular vote. For me, being extremely picky and careful of what products I put in my hair, it is saying a lot when I say that I found a winner. This duo is like heaven for my hair and I plan on sticking with it! If you are looking for help with your thick/curly/frizzy/dry strands...give Coconut Miracle Oil conditioner a try and thank me later!
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;Tames the frizz
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;Love the smell.  My hair is very touchable.  Tames the curls.
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;perfect for soft hair
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;hair came out silky
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;I'm broke so I asked the store associate for reccomendqrions. she suggested this. I bought it. I used it. it works very well. the shampoo isn't super Sudsy. I love that. the more suds and bubbles the more damage and stripping of natural oils to your hair. love the product. smells great. doesnt make my hair greasy. I was worried bc I have baby fine yet super duper thick hair. the ends of my hair are super dry. this helped. I followed up with the conditioner and the miracle oil. they're great.
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;I bought this bc I'm broke and cannot afford expensive shampoo right now tbh... a lady in ulta recommended this product. I clutched my pearls because everyone has always told me that this brand is bad for your hair. I'm guessing they have changed their formula up a bit.  this product is actually amazing. smells great. moisturizes the hair. do not expect it to foam up. lots of foam is more damaging and strips hair of it's natural oils anyway.. leaving your hair dry and brittle. I do enjoy this product. if all goes well I might completely make the switch to this brand
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;Great product helps repair hair!!
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;I've been looking for an affordable alternative to my more expensive hair care favorites and I think I'll just have to go back to what I was using before. I wash my hair 1-2 times a week as it is dry and frizzy, and doesn't get oily fast. I was hoping the Coconut Miracle Oil duo would help keep my hair soft, as I need to use a little more product to get good results. My hair was soft for a couple of weeks, but after a couple of washes with this particular range, my hair felt kind of dry and my ends were starting to split. Adding a mask from the same line doesn't help. I think this is okay if you're not picky and have normal, fine hair, it just wasn't for me. It smells really pretty, though, but I don't think there is a lot of oil in this product. Back to the drawing board.
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;it smells great! It makes my hair soft and bouncy and really improved my curl texture! I use this with the conditioner and mousse and so far so good! Would buy again.
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;Leaves my hair soft when used with the conditioner
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;Leaves my hair nice and soft when used the the shampoo
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;"my amazing hairstylist recommended me OGX, and i took it upon myself to pick this rainbow one out, because i LOVE coconut and this was advertised as ""miracle oil"" for my coarse [and sometimes dry] hair. when i used this, it didn't smell like coconut, more like odd plastic-y chemicals. this shampoo also doesn't foam well (if at all), and you have to fight with it to come out of the tube like a gel. because it doesn't foam, i don't get as much coverage on my scalp and thus have to use more than normal. my previous shampoo, garnier fructis (laughably a cheap brand, but at least i'm trying to upgrade my hair game!), i would use a fraction of the amount that i have to use of this OGX 'miracle' shampoo. not happy about this purchase, will not purchase again. also 3x as pricey as fructis if you measure oz for oz. PASS."
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;I bought this conditioner with the shampoo during a trip because I forgot my regular products. I have bleached and dyed my hair for years now, so I'm always looking to add moisture back into my locks. To my surprise, this pair moisturized AND restored a lot of the natural body and texture in my hair. Affordable and effective.
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;This conditioner smells good, like you're in Hawaii! My hair feels so soft and hydrated when I use this. I have fine hair thats relatively thin. It doesnt weigh my hair down at all. I love this with the matching shampoo. Love it!
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;This shampoo smells good, like you're in Hawaii! My hair feels so soft and hydrated when I use this. I have fine hair thats relatively thin. It doesnt weigh my hair down at all. Love it!
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;"The first time I used this my scalp itched. I thought I was having a weird reaction to the coconut oil in this, but it couldn't be because I put raw coconut oil on my hair from time to time and have no itchiness. After I used this a few more times the itchiness sort of stopped, but this doesn't really moisturize my hair. It feels dry down to the ends and sort of frizzy. I'm a ""you buy it, you find some way to use it until it's gone"" kind of person and this is doable when you use a hair mask or hair oil in conjunction with it. It's also sulfate free so that is good for my color treated hair. There seems to be not very many choices for sulfate free products! But I don't think I will buy this again, even though it has a great price."
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;I love the smell of this product except the smell fades within hours of washing. It doesn't lather well until ALOT of product is applied. It also doesn't give the deep scalp clean feeling like other shampoos might however I do like it and think my hair is healthier from using it.
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;Works pretty good gives shine and pretty awsome smell in one week of used ...
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;I really love this stuff. I do wish they made this in much bigger bottles. I also wish they would change the lids on their bottles to a flatter lid so it stood in the shower better when the product is running low. I use 2 bottles of this to 1 shampoo bottle. It really does detangle and add moisture back into my hair. I have really long straight yet wavy hair and it gets extremely dry from the mid shaft down. I always end up using far more conditioner than shampoo in any product I buy. I love this in the winter time and dry climates when my hair needs that extra moisture the most in conjunction with the shampoo and hair oil. It's great for detangling and adds a nice shine. Does nothing for static. But helps to keep my hair moisturized when I really need it the most without feeling greasy or weighed down. I do not get product build up or find that after a while it just doesn't work for me anymore. I really love it. I'm not crazy about vanilla and coconut scents. So I usually use a body mist to cover it up. But a lot of people compliment me on me way it smells when I forget to apply mist. But hands down it works great if you like the smell or not. And it isn't atrusive just not my thing. But it is my go to when I really need the moisture in my hair. I find it far More productive than the Argan oil line in the winter months. But I love the Argan line for summer and humid climates.
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;Great shampoo for the winter months to add some moisture back into my hair. It's a little heavy on my hair in the summer. But it is great for dry climates when I travel or the dry winter air. Wish they would change the lids to flat lids so it is easier to stand up in the shower when the product is running low. I also wish they made this in jumbo bottle sizes. I use this along with the hair oil and conditioner. I have really long hair and my end and middle shaft get very dry. The triple combo helps to keep it from getting brittle. I don't recommend the hair mask with it. I found it to be very drying and counter productive. It actually made my hair worse. I really hate the hair mask. But the shampoo conditioner and hair oil are lovely.
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;My hair was so dry & damaged I think bc I was using the wrong brand! I've always liked OGX products but had switched 2 try some high end ones & none have worked as good as this one. So I'm back on to using this brand's products again. And for the price I'll always continue to buy!
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;Made my hair smoother and did not dry it out.
Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner;It smells great, but really REALLY dried my hair out. It causes bad frizz.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I have been using this product for a few months & have lost so much hair since I have been using. I did not think it was related to the product until I did some research.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I've been using this product for several months, and it left my hair in worse condition than before.  It's way too soft -- and fly-away!  None of which is an improvement over no conditioner at all.  The only good thing I experienced with this product is the fragrance -- if it was a product that did even the minimum of what any conditioner should do, I would buy it just for the fragrance.  Too bad, because I love other OGX products.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;It'll make your hair feel full and give volume, but at the same time it'll weigh it down. Your hair will become oily, and be due for a wash compared to normal time.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I bought this shampoo hoping I could achieve more thick and voluminous hair. However, after using this product only 2 times it left a waxy/sticky coat over my hair and actually made me loose hair. I have never used a product that made me loose so much hair especially if it claims to strengthen your hair
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;As a conditioner
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;i am so disappointed that a product I have used forever has changed. I noticed no difference in shampoo. But this new formula for the conditioner is just sad. totally dries out hair as if theres no conditioner in it at all. My first clue was it was not squeezing out of the bottle right. It actually tangles my hair leaving it hard now and not soft and easy to get a wide tooth comb through this thin hair. I am so disappointed and am going to have to change brands. I pulled out a sample bottle and then this. The ingredient's are switched around and some changed. I am going to have to throw away a bottle 3/4 full. I used so much last night to try to make it work and its still horrid.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Not sure if this is a bad bottle, but I have a heck of a time getting product out of container, and when I do, its just a blob and it doesn't lather up.  Not to impressed at this point.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I was surprised I liked this shampoo and conditioner so much. I think the people who didn't like it probably were using it every time they washed their hair. I alternate with a higher quality shampoo and conditioner (lanza and a purple shampoo) and I've never had a problem with build up. Im obsessed with the smell! I can go to bed with my hair wet and just brush it in the morning and it looks like I just had a blow out.  Is this the best shampoo and conditioner for the health of your hair? Probably not.. but its a good one to have in the shower for the days you want something different.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Smells absolutely awful, would NOT recommend!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;"This is the strangest shampoo (and the conditioner) to me. I am used to shampoos that feel frothy and rich, and conditioners that feel silky when I rinse them out. I do a lot of detangling with my fingers in the shower because my hair is so long. It's well past my waist, almost to the top of my legs. Finger detangling in the shower helps prevent a lot of breakage. This shampoo (and the conditioner) scared me at first. I could hardly get my fingers through my hair. It knotted up when I shampooed, and took forever to get the knots out. The shampoo seemed to completely strip my hair, or so it felt. I'm talking SQUEEEEEAKY clean. I assumed that when it dried, it would look like a broom. But it didn't. I also used the conditioner, which didn't give me a warm fuzzy feeling, either. I didn't use any detangler or hair oil out of the shower because I wanted to see exactly how this stuff worked for me. I carefully detangled with a flat detangling brush and let it air dry. And it looked amazing! I was shocked. My hair was so shiny and soft. It had lots of movement, and my waves had definition. I've used about half of both bottles so far, and I'm not seeing any change. My hair doesn't seem to be drying out or breaking, and I haven't noticed any unusual hair fall. I'm still on the fence, though, because it's so difficult to detangle. The ""after"" is great for me. It's getting there that's difficult, and I don't like spending ages on my hair. I want to wash, detangle, and let it air dry on its own."
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Great product!! Loved it! Give a heavy hair look. happy with purchase.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I recently cut my waist-length hair off to about my jawline, and was seriously concerned about volume. My hair has always been super thin, so when I chopped it off, I was instantly on the hunt for a good voluming shampoo. I work at Ulta and despite my employee discount, I'm not a fan of dropping a ton of money on shampoos because I like to mix mine to get various benefits. OGX has worked great for me in the past and I love that it's cruelty free and very affordable. While this shampoo in particular doesn't smell the ~best~ it works AMAZING. My hair has gotten some SERIOUS volume since I've started using it and I've found myself using less volumizing styling products just because I don't want my hair to look poofy! Can't say I've had to deal with that before! Overall, I totally recommend and will plan on getting this again once I run out!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;So far I love it
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This made my hair feel dry and as if there was a coat of sticky wax covering it - will not be buying again
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I have used several different kinds of shampoo and this one made my thin post postpartum hair thick and healthy
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;After trying this product for two months, I'm going tomorrow to get my long hair cut off at my neck because it feels like straw, is breaking, and falling out.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I read the other reviews about the DMDM in this that causes hair loss. After using this shampoo my hair falls out, is dry and brittle. Looking at the ingredients on Ulta's website, the DMDM is not listed. On the bottle in my shower it's listed plain as day!! Why didn't ulta include it on their ingredients?! That's shady.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This shampoo knotted my hair up so bad, and I experienced so much hair loss. Honestly while I was using it I never thought anything of it until i seen that other people were experiencing the same issue, it also dried out my hair. Never will purchase this again!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;The best product ever if you have damaged hair
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I've been using this for about 2 years, thinking it was good for my hair. WRONG! It has DMDM Hydantoin as well as other ingredients that DAMAGE your hair and cause HAIR LOSS! As a 27-yr old experiencing hair loss, this is not okay!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I decided to try this after reading an article rating shampoos for thin hair, (this was the reasonably priced option) and boy I'm sure glad I did! My very fine, very thin hair seems thicker and fuller after only about a week of daily washing! It also does not seem to be drying like other shampoos I've tried. I was very skeptical, but this has certainly lived up to it's recommendation. I definitely recommend it.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Unfortunately I used this for years since it's sulfate and paraben free. However it has DMDM hydantoin!!! This is no better than using tresemme. Look up the lawsuits and save your hair. I switched to hempz shampoo and conditioner
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;My husband used this product, and his scalp was very irritated.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I started noticing hair loss after a few times using this shampoo and conditioner. At the time I didnt think none of it until my shower got clogged. When I unclogged it and seen the amount of hair I lost I wanted to cry. I immediately threw the product away and stopped using it. I then googled what causes hair loss and seen that this product contains DMDM hydantoin and sodium chloride. Which both ingredients are bad for your scalp & causes hair loss.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I used it for 3 times now. It's really good shampoo. The only negative thing - the smell is too strong.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I can't honestly rate this for how it works but I will tell you if you don't like that fake coconut smell that smells like a car air freshener, you will hate this smell.  It's just like it.  Must return.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;After using the shampoo and conditioner for only one week, my hair has so much volume and looks healthy!  I am not losing hair as I was before.  So impressed with this product!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This product smells great and leaves my hair soft
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I've been using this shampoo for a few weeks now, because I wanted my hair to feel thicker and more voluminous. The first few times I used it, I thought my hair looked super shiny and clean. As I've continued to use it, I've noticed a drastic REDUCTION in my hair's volume. My hair is so limp and feels incredibly thin now. The shampoo smells good and it does make my hair shiny, but it is not worth all the fall out!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;So I tried switching to different shampoos and conditioners to see differences, and I always go back to this!! The only shampoo and conditioner that leaves my hair so soft and healthy feeling. My hair grew the longest when I used this. Will always stick with it!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Seriously like food for my hair!! Thankful & please do not change formula or do anything with this product! Life changing!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I purchased this after seeing thousands of great reviews of several sites. I question if the reviews are legit because this stuff is terrible! The shampoo along with the conditioner will dry out your hair! My hair was so dry, coarse and difficult to straighten with a straightener after using this. Usually after shampooing and conditioning, your hair immediately becomes softer and you can run your fingers through it. I couldn't run my fingers through my hair at all in the shower with the conditioner that goes along with this shampoo. The texture / fragrance of this stuff reminds me of something you'd find at a cheap discount store. It is not worth the price. I am throwing both bottles out and purchasing new ones because it is ruining my hair!!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Dried my hair out severely and made it start falling out! I've always been super self conscious of my thin hair and now it's worse than before. So disappointed.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I wash my hair twice a week while it stays full and soft and  feeling good with how my hair feels.  With what I was using left a coating and flats on my hair and I lost more hair.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;"I honestly am torn between liking and disliking this product. The shampoo and conditioner does what it's labeled to do, my hair is noticeable thicker and has more texture. However, it's almost thick to the point where it has lost all natural shape and bounce and just wants to poof out like a box around my head. It's almost crunchy. On top of that, the product leaves a waxy film on your hair and on your skin that is impossible to rinse out completely. I guess that's what makes your hair feel ""thicker""? It smells really strong too, like reallyyyy strong. I like the smell because it reminds me of warm vanilla sugar, but sensitive users beware. Like I said, does the job, but due to its quirks I will not be repurchasing."
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I bought this shampoo and conditioner desperately looking for something to help me with my rapidly thinning hair.  My hair has gotten so thin that I can see my scalp throughout it so I was hoping to find a product to help add volume.  At first the product was really helping my hair look great, and then I started to notice a film being left on my scalp after showering no matter how well I rinsed my hair.  This film made my hair feel grimy and my scalp was itchy....so the search for a perfect shampoo and conditioner continues.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Where has this been my whole life!!! It smells amazing, my hair feels so much thicker, shinier, so soft and not frizzy at all. I love love love this formula.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Smells nice but made my hair feel incredibly dry. I have tried other organix products and loved them but the collagen ones just dry out my hair for some reason.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;i was a little sceptical about trying it because of all the bad reviews but i figured hey why not my hair was already falling out ALOT and i mean literal bunches of hair i was so depressed about it and decided to give it a try let me tell you i was so happy to see only a couple hairs go down the drain after i showered i also noticed it helped with the itching on my scalp i was so sick of using head and shoulders it made my hair stink! this one smells sweet like vanilla :) the only bad thing is it does make your hair dry so i use the ogx coconut serum for that  , other than that i love how full my hair feels now and also how much it stopped falling out
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I used this shampoo religiously for two or three years now. I loved the smell and it gave good softness and volume to my thin, fine hair. I recently noticed more and more of my hair falling out in the shower and began to fear the worst, like a hormone issue, until I happened to read a review for this shampoo and everyone else was mentioning hair loss. Put it in the trash immediately and moved on to a new brand and the hair loss is slowly stopping but it's going to be a long journey to get it back to normal.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This shampoo turned into gel after two weeks! It's super sticky now and can't be washed out of my hair. It was even hard to get off of my hands. The first few uses were good but i had to throw it away after only a few weeks
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I was using this shampoo and conditioner for a while because I have fine hair, and lack of volume, so it seemed like a great solution! I started using it for a few months and noticed the hair appeared to be thicker, and slightly more voluminous. However, shortly after, I got my hair colored and bought some salon quality shampoo and conditioner to protect the color and used that. Flash Forward, the salon hair product is gone and I switch back to this product. I didn't think anything of it at first, I noticed my hair didn't feel as soft but wasn't too bothered by it. A few days of using it and I'm noticing my hair will not stop getting greasy by the end of the day! With the salon product I could easily go two maybe three days without washing, with this product I can barely go one. It's irritating for me because I'm not sweating profusely or working out in any way. The only difference is this shampoo/conditioner. Also I've notice it's difficult to run my fingers through my hair, as well as to brush it, And I definitely have an increase of tangles and knots. Like others have mentioned, it must be product build up in the hair. The other let down is the  conditioner formula is really thin and barely feels like it moisturizes my hair at all, somehow it feels more stripped of moisture after using it in the shower. honestly had it not been for my Salon product experience I might not have never noticed but I'm glad I did!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;"Have used for a long time. Definitely helps hair look and feel more full. Not a new formula. There was an additional Biotin kind that OGX launched called ""Extra Strength"" or something, but this Thick and Full Biotin one looks to still be the same."
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I have thick wavy hair that is naturally very soft and manageable. This shampoo and conditioner made it impossible to brush through or do anything with, and it left a sticky residue. My hair was very dry but greasy at the roots, and my hair feels a lot thinner than when I started using it.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Got this because it seemed to have good ingredients. Biotin, collagen, vitamins, etc. Is sold as sulfate free but the third ingredient is a sulfate. I use this product like I've used others and after using this my scalp is always itching, I'm starting to get flakes, and normally I wash my hair 2 times a week but since using this, I can't be the day after washing my hair is insanely oily. Idk what the issue is with this company and their products but I've had the same problem when I used their keratin shampoo a few years ago.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This left a heavy film on my hair that made it feel nasty and unmanageable. My hair started falling out because of this. I threw this and the shampoo in the trash.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This shampoo and conditioner stripped my hair.  My hair is naturally dry, anyway, and it took 3 months to restore it (let is grow out). I keep my hair short.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I couldn't figure out why my hair felt so terrible the past few weeks. Usually, it is smooth and doesnt take much to detangle. I thought there was something wrong with me, until I realized I had recently started using this conditioner. I threw it out, used a Wella conditioner last night instead, and my hair is back to normal, although now I have breakage  due to how much I had to comb through knots in my hair because of this conditioner. Skip this one people, save your hair
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Used the OGX Thick and Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo for YEARS, and it made a huge difference to improve the thickness of my hair. But the ingredients are now different, and... just no. Not the same. In the history of cosmetics and hair products, I've only ever encountered 2 products that were truly improved when the ingredients changed. This was not one of those 2 products. I'm not looking forward to the annoyance of finding a new shampoo.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;i like that this shampoo is sulfate free, i don't think it did anything for thickness, and the fragrance is a bit too strong but smells nice
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Love the smell, love the feel afterwards, less frizzy and easier to manage. LOVE THIS!!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Replay I feel different when only one use
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Please use caution with this shampoo. I had used OGX brand products in the past (Argan Oil), and never had issues. However, about a week into using this shampoo and conditioner I noticed a large amount of hair fall and actually noticed several completely bald spots on my head. It made my hair extremely dry, tangled, and unmanageable. I know some people love it and have no issues, but I really wish I would have read more reviews before using. I'm now devastated and trying to grow my hair back.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I was excited to try this da shampoo and conditioner because I have had good experiences with other products from this brand, however I am not impressed with this one. It made my hair feel very waxy/greasy and dried my ends out quite a bit. I have fine hair strands, but thick hair overall. It weighed my hair down rather than adding volume. Might work for other hair types but not mine particularly.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Ever since I discovered this product shampoo and conditioner in my local supermarket, that's all I ever use now. I leave a tad bit conditioner in my hair for manageability after I wash my hair. My hair is so soft and full looking. I've gotten many compliments how healthy my hair looks. Great Product !! Thanks
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This conditioner is very thin and has barely any slip which made detangling my curly hair very hard, I gave it two stars because it did make my hair grow faster because of the biotin but it is very drying, as soon as I step out of the shower my hair feels silicone-e and it definitely made my hair frizzier.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This product is literally the best. My hair started falling a lot and I'm only 22 and I had no idea why. I started investing in all these hair shampoos for thinning hair like purador and Moroccan oil shampoo but they all made my hair fall in clumps. There was so much hair in the drain. My friend told me to buy the ogx biotin shampoo and conditioner and let me tell you, the results were amazing! After one use there was literally 2 strands of hair in the drain when I was done. And the best thing is you only need a drop. A little goes a long way. It definitely helped my itchy dry scalp and I can feel my hair getting thicker. YOU GUYS MUST TRY!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Beware- this will make your hair fall out in CLUMPS in the shower. Will never use again!!!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I swear by OGX conditioner. Even when I treat my hair with heat every day, this helps keep the split ends away. It's always surprising to my hair stylist how I have almost no split ends.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I used Nioxin for about 3 months. I did get compliments about my hair looking thicker but it left my hair extremely dry and frizzy. The first day after using this, I received the same compliments but also was told my hair looked healthier! Definitely using this instead, plus I'm saving a lot of money!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Looking for a new shampoo. Not much better than what I used already.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Was recommended by a friend but doesn't work for me. Needed to use another product to get the tangles out and moisturize
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I see a lot of people asking about what kind of scent this is all the time, and it states that it is a floral. Could be true, but I would compare it smelling to Aquolina pink sugar perfume, or sugar Scentsy bar. One of the reasons I use this shampoo, is for the awesome scent!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Not recommended for curly/course hair
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I wanted to give this product a try because I was loosing hair by the hand fulls and my hair is getting very thin. After just the first few uses I notice no lose of hair my hair was smooth and soft. The more I use it I'm noticing it getting frizzy but only loose a few strands vs a ton. I will continue to use this shampoo and conditioner.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I used this multiple times & was never able to fully wash it out ever. It leaves my hair with a waxy residue that makes it impossible to run my fingers through or brush easily. It is therefore prone to tangling and breaking. I normally have fine, smooth, and somewhat slippery hair & while this product gave the appearance of volume, it was simply product buildup making the strands appear thicker. Would not recommend, I am throwing out the remaining product.

Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Been buying this shampoo since summer. Keeps your hair full & moisturized. Smells great!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I have damaged hair due to bleaching it over 8yrs. I recently went brunette. I've been looking for a shampoo to help with my hair. My hair is damaged and feels frizzy and dry. After reading the reviews on here, I wanted to give it a try. Let me tell youC best thing ever! My hair was soft after getting out of the shower. I didn't even struggle to brush my hair. I totally recommend it if you have damaged hair. If it doesn't work out for you, you can always return it.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I use this shampoo every day.  It is the best I have used as far as keeping my hair stronger and healthier
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;And i used to use it a lot. But yeah if you just want your hair to smell delicious buy it.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I've received comments and noticed the thickness and shine
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;"Honestly, I had high hopes for this shampoo.  After using it, I noticed my head itching.  Then I started to feel bumps.  At first I thought ""maybe it's something else"", so I tried a different shampoo for a few days.  My scalp got better.  Went back to this shampoo/conditioner and the bumps are back and my head itches."
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;"""Dimethicone (which is in this product) is used as a sealant against water and even air. It is not a natural ingredient, and its side effects are bad for our hair. It gives the hair the illusion of shine, but it is not the shine we want—it is a fake shine from the plastic."" DO NOT BUY!"
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;my hair has grown so much since i started using this shampoo in the summer. 10 times out of 10 if my friends haven't seen me in two weeks they always comment on how my hair has gotten even longer since they've seen me! but also note my hair is healthy and i have rarely used heat in about a year. so not sure the effects on damaged hair
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I wash my hair 2-3 a week.  The crown of my head has noticeable breakage and this shampoo is helping alleviate that.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This hasn't really done anything for my hair. It's fine as a conditioner, but I dont think it's a great choice if you're trying to repair damage.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;My hair was falling in bulk really bad and I read this shampoo was good so I decided to give it a try and iam really happy with the results. I had 2 bald spots on my head and hair is starting to grow back again...
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I tried out the shampoo and conditioner as my sister had just bought it and the reviews seemed very promising but this DRIED MY HAIR OUT SO BAD! My hair has never felt or looked more dehydrated and frizzy. I will say they both smelled very nice and felt hydrating while I had used them in the shower but I did not like the way my hair dried at all. Very disappointed.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I want to love this shampoo simply because of the smell, but everytime i wash, it leaves my hair dull and greasy. I thought maybe it was just when I blow dried, but even after letting it air dry, it looked terrible. It always feels like the stuff isn't fully washed out every.single.time. It's so frustrating!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This is literally the worst conditioner I've ever used. It leaves so much build up on my hair, it makes me cringe. It feels like I didn't wash the conditioner out, and I stood in the shower EXTRA to make sure I got it all out. The reason people think that this gives them volume is because it just leaves build up on your hair! Avoid this product like the plague.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I used this in conjunction with the shampoo. I found that my hair looks thicker and fuller. conditioner makes my hair feel very soft and helps with tangles.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Does what it says. Leaves hair looking fuller and thicker.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Light weight and takes a small amount to use. Make my hair softer and easier to comb after washing my hair.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Inexpensive and works great
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;After just 3 to 4 washes I can tell the difference. I've used biometrix full density and OGX works 10x better
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;These shampoo and conditions are the best.  Safe for color treated and keratin treated hair.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Smells great! Leaves my hair soft & manageable.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I have two large drawerfuls of shampoo and conditioner. I'm always on the hunt for a shampoo that will tame my frizzy hair but not make it flat. This shampoo not only leaves my hair looking healthy but leaves my hair looking full and thick
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I have naturally straight, thin, fine hair and I have been using this shampoo for about a week now and my hair definitely feels fuller and thicker. I personally alternate every other wash using a normal shampoo because I don't want my hair to become too full and thick. Highly recommend for those with thin hair!!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Literally the best shampoo ever! I was experiencing serious fall outs, horrible! Was looking for a good shampoo and saw this on the shelf at Ulta. I have tried really expensive ones and never got the result I was looking for- promises of soft, shiny and etc. never happened with other ones. This biotin shampoo and conditioner not only leaves my hair sooo soft - living in humid Texas- but also has reduced the fall outs drastically. By drastically I mean if I was loosing 100 hair a day now it is like 10 a day. I hope it stays the same for my hair and scalp. I ordered two more of the big ones. Thanks for the great product. Hope it helps other people. Btw my hair is colored and my husband is also enjoying this shampoo and conditioner.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I have thin hair, and I love using the shampoo/conditioner combo because it leaves my hair looking thick.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Love the smell of this shampoo. Leaves my hair looking beautiful.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I really like this shampoo/conditioner combo. Great smell, keeps my hair tamed and voluminous. I am a biolage fiend but I couldnt justify the price for them anymore. For jumbo sizes OGX is affordable for my budget and even better durring the Jumbo Shampoo & Conditioner sale. I like using this and then blowdrying my hair after with their OGX thermal protector silk blowout cream.

Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Smells like literal heaven. I cannot stop smelling it. BUT after i wash my hair with it, i can't smell it on my hair hours later like i can with other shampoos which makes me sad.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I love this   Conditioner  It works so well it's great for fine hair
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I have tried matrix, kenra, and redken. You wont find anything else that will give you more volume than this one.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;The shampoo made my hair really soft, but the conditioner dried it out. Honestly used this and the shampoo for at least 2 or 3 months and saw no change in my hair.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I noticed a big difference with my hair after about 3 weeks of use.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I mixed this conditioner with olaplex and L'Oréal professional deep conditioner and I love the way my hair feels. My hair stylist even noticed my hair has been growing out. Definitely saw a change in hair growth more than I did with the biotin vitamins I was taking
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This shampoo (and the matching conditioner) do make my hair feel soft, and the smell is great. But after 3 months of scalp acne I've decided that I need to change to something else. I've never had that problem before, and didn't even know that it could be a problem until now.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I have long fine color treated hair. After using the conditioner for a couple weeks I noticed my hair in my brush about 2x the regular amount and every time I ran my hand through my hair, I would have 5-10 strands in my hand multiple times. DO NOT BUY THIS if you want to keep your hair. I did like how my hair felt silky and felt light but it's totally not worth it haha.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Ever since Ive been using this product people have been asking me if I got hair extensions. It makes my hair look soo full. I use it with the marula oil conditioner - great combination as it keeps my ends hydrated. I also have a sensitive scalp in which most shampoos cause flaking but this shampoo doesnt irritate. So thankful to have bought this. Originally bought in store but will now be purchasing online religously :D
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Have bought this product before....it's great for body
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;After 6 weeks of use, my hair is not thicker and I still have no volume. My hair is smooth, but I was looking for some volume.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I love this product! Definitely my new go to conditioner. I have not tried the shampoo yet, but after this I'm definitely going to!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Honestly i love it! i had really dry scalp and this helped so much i tried many shampoos and conditioners and none seemed to work for me except this one! It made my hair super silky soft!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I bought the shampoo and conditioner and LOVE THEM! I have fine, thinning hair. This really plumps up my hair, smells great, and doesn't leave my hair greasy after a few hours. Smells yummy too!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Almost seems like a miracle. My hair is gorgeous after one use. Soft, bouncy and full of life.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;good
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I bought this product in February after reading some good reviews. I wanted to grow my hair out and add volume to it. Though this product did help me grow my hair, it broke me out SO BAD the minute I started using it and no matter what I tried, the breakouts were too big and aggressive. I've finally decided to stop using it because the outcome is not worth it. I would not recommend this to anyone, as there are many other products that can help you grow your hair that won't break you out severely!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This shampoo does what it says and actually the first week I used it I got two compliments on how long and great my hair looked. However, it's  not worth the rash and scalp acne it caused. At first I thought I could manage a little hairline acne but now my scalp is completely irritated and my sideburns are full of acne. This has only happened to me once before (with Herbal Essences products) so I wouldn't say I have a sensitive scalp or anything, this is just really harsh I guess.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This and the matching conditioner get the job done. I've been using them for 3 months. However, I personally didn't notice any dramatic changes. I don't really see any extra volume or a thicker/fuller effect on my hair, like the shampoo claims. Overall, it is a nice shampoo but I won't repurchase.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Eh wouldn't buy it again.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I love this product. My braiding stylist used it once after I ran out of my normal conditioner and I've been hooked. That was about a year ago. I love the smell and the price. My hair is thick and kinky. I am a 4a/b hair texture. Yes, it detangles too and I am very tender headed so I am a fan!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Daughter's hair has never looked this good or been this easy to take care of
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This conditioner smells amazing. But that's about all the positive I have to say about this. It leaves residue in my hair and is causing some buildup. It's also super drying and causing my hair to be slightly unmanageable when trying to comb out afterwards. I will continue to use in small amounts along with a leave in conditioner that I now have to use to make my hair manageable but I will not repurchase.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This shampoo smells amazing. It lathers well and feels good in the shower. However, it doesn't do much for adding volume or thickness to my hair. And I think it's a bit drying. The matching conditioner doesn't do much for the dryness either. Will probably use until it's gone but won't repurchase.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This conditioner instantly gets out all tangles and knots in my curly hair no matter how many days old it is!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I purchased OGX because it came recommended by a hairstylist friend. I have somewhat oily, fine, wavy/straight hair. This shampoo/conditioner leaves my hair so dry and it feels like I didn't wash all of the product out every time. Not fan. Smells nice and the conditioned is nice and thick.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Great quality shampoo at a great price. Plus, it smells amazing!! My hair feels so clean after using this shampoo, yet it's gentle and doesn't dry my hair out. It actually feels stronger.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;gave this shampoo/conditioner a go but did not become a fan. It made my hair greasy by the second day, the smell was not pleasant and it made my hair fallout. i WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS SHAMPOO/CONDITIONER.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I have fine hair and volume/body is always a concern. I saw a noticeable difference within 2 uses! I love this shampoo!!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I gave this shampoo/conditioner combo a go, and I totally hate it! It leaves a thick, almost waxy feeling to my hair afterwards and it weighs it down so much. I thought maybe I was using too much product, so I used less, but even then it still left a very unpleasant feeling to my hair after my hair dries. Not to mention my hair looks like a grease ball by day 2! I won't be repurchasing.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I'm unsure if it's the shampoo, conditioner, or a combination of both, but this certain line of OGX leaves my hair with a waxy, weighed down feeling afterwards. I've tried using less product (thinking I was using too much) but even then it leaves a unpleasant feeling to my hair. Not a fan!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Every time I shampoo my hair
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I use this shampoo every other day with the matching conditioner and have told friends about it. I love the full thickness it gives my hair!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I love this shampoo (along with the matching conditioner). I noticed my hair was fuller after one use. Gives much better results than some expensive brands I've tried. Will buy again!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;We used this as our girls weekend out! And we all loved the smell and how it made our hair feel. We all have different types of hair.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;"This product is full of harmful sulfates that WILL dry your hair out. Depending on the individuals hair, they may notice right away (first use) or they may not notice until multiple or even several uses. But this WILL damage your hair. Having hair that ""APPEARS"" thicker is not worth the possibility of going bald. I mean the amount of reviewers with an experience of hair falling out is enough to make you not want to take the risk anyway. This shampoo did nothing for my hair back when I used it but make it extremely dry, brittle, itchy, tangled, etc. IF YOU WANT THICKER OR LONGER HAIR JUST TAKE ACTUAL BIOTIN VITAMINS. Try the rice water technique. Try using less heavy products. There are a ton of other ways that worked for me. This just wasn't one of them."
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This shampoo dried my hair out so much and didn't give me any volume at all. My hair has always been really dry and thick so maybe it would work better on thinner or oily hair.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;My hair was thinning out a lot and I was starting to get worried. I've been super stressed and also breastfed my daughter for a year. Immediately after using my hair felt, clean fuller and thicker. I was shocked! I also purchased conditioner. And would recommend using both. I used just shampoo one time without conditioner and it felt fluffy. I'm so happy I found this!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I have purchase this product and was excited to try it considering the great reviews I read, after the first wash it left my hair feeling silky, soft and smelling good. I even noticed the boost in volume. Shortly after less then 2 weeks of using this product my hair began to fall out in HUGE clumps and it left my hair greasy and dry and at the ends.. I would not recommend anyone buying this if you have dry or straight hair..
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I wash my hair every other day and the volume it gives is great
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Left my scalp dry and flaky and my hair oily
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This product (and even the brand) have been so hyped by people around me that I decided to try it this semester.  Upon reading some other comments here, I FINALLY figured out I'm not the only one struggling with this shampoo!  Before using this product, I had thick, wavy hair that I loved.  Sure I've changed lengths and cut my bangs 4 times here and there, but I've never dyed it and the texture has always been the same.  I've been using this shampoo consistently for 4 months waiting for my thick hair to come back.  I'm a nightshower-er, so I use this right before bed.  Twice a week, I've been conditioning with their coconut milk conditioner.  I've been waking up the morning after itching my head like I have a terrible case of lice (even though I have NO bugs in my head and don't see any dandruff), and I continue to feel the urge to itch it throughout the entire day.  My scalp has been ridiculously waxy and greasy all the time as well, and it's gotten to the point where dried shampoo can't even dry all that gunk out for a few hours while I'm in class or at work.  Plus, the whole bottom half of my locks are all dried up, so having my hair down closely resembles a wet rat.  I wear my hair up most of the time to cover it.  It feels so good to know I'm not alone, and I'll DEFINITELY be trying a new product ASAP.
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;This shampoo lathers so well! My hair feels and smells super clean! And most importantly, my hair looks thicker and more healthy. I actually got lots of compliments on my hair after using it!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;I have 3b thin hair and I bought this product excitedly hoping it would give my hair the fullness i've always wanted but instead my hair ended up falling out in clumps :( didn't give the product 1 star because it probably works better on straight hair despite saying it works on any hair type and it smells really really good
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Don't use this product daily because it will ruin your hair. It will cause it to thin out. I have naturally thick hair and I used this product and my hair was ruined after continual use. Just don't use this product at all— there is much better out there!
Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner;Before I went natural I used to straighten my hair 24/7 every day and it broke off a chunk of hair unfortunately but this stuff fixed that and grew out my hair and made it more thicker!! I am now natural (3b curl type) and I still use this product and it still works just as good!!
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;i been using this brand for a year and has my hair so soft and great. love the smell.
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;The scent is way to strong and artificial. Also it takes a lot of effort to make it lather up. Gave me dandruff too.
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;Smells great, made my hair feel healthy, but it made my hair fall out in clumps.
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;Ever since I started using this my hair feels so soft and silky! My hair is very thin and brittle, I have a lot of split ends but since I started to use this I have definitely seen an improvement and my hair definitely looks a lot shiner and healthier than before.
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;Smells great but it made my hair very dry after using it.  Wouldn't use this everyday
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;This product did not wow me at all. I really hoped that my hair would feel more hydrated and restored but it falls flat for me. No nice lather and my hair feels frizzy and not hydrated. Also it smells like playdough.
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;Ive used this conditioner before and never had a problem now its making me break out all over my face and neck. The product is unusable.
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;I have thin, fine and dry/damaged hair and I thought this product would bring some moisture back into my hair but I was wrong. The conditioner does absolutely nothing to my hair, might even make it worse. After combing it through my wet hair in the shower and letting it sit for a few minutes you'd think when washing it out my hair would be smooth and moisturized but it's the complete opposite. I can't even get through the knots and have so much trouble brushing after I get out of the shower. I never write reviews but I just couldn't believe this was rated so highly bc it SUCKS
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;My hair was extremely damaged. I tried this shampoo and conditioner and my hair is healthy now! I've been using this for a few months and my hair couldn't be better.
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;The smell was great. After my first attempt to use it, my hair was still very knotty. On my second attempt, I used a lot more and left it on longer. Once again, my hair was left knotty and almost felt like it had a coating on it once it was dry.
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;This product is amazing!!! I used it on a whim after I had fried my hair with bleach. It was in horrible condition breaking off, hard to brush/comb, falling out and the ends were horribly damaged. After using the shampoo and conditioner for a few weeks, my hair came back to life!!! It also smells really good. I now use it regularly since I often color and use heat products and my hair looks shiny and healthy!!!
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;This is the worst shampoo. You will get a lot of dandruff after using this shampoo and your hair will feel really dry.
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;i'd give the shampoo a 6.5/10 it smelled very good, but it was a bit drying to my hair. I have very thick 3c curly hair. the conditioner would be an 10/10 it smelled amazing, even better then the shampoo and it was so moisturizing. I detangled my hair in half the time. I recommended for curly hair.
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;I have blonde color treated hair and this actually moisturizers my damaged strands and I LOVE the smell
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;After a few consistent professional hair colorings, my 3a/b curly hair was dull, lifeless, and a huge frizzy ball— my curl was nearly nonexistent. Within 3 uses of Coconut miracle oil shampoo, conditioner, and penetrating oil, I noticed a difference. My hair is silky, my curls are coming back, and it is SO much easier to brush through. I highly recommend!
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;I bought both the shampoo and the conditioner and they work great together but I would also recommend using the tea tree oil and mint shampoo with the conditioner. Both products from this set are really good if you are trying to hold out on getting a trim. Super hydrating and made my hair feel soft and shiny. The one complaint is that after awhile it's almost like it stopped keeping my hair soft and smooth. It was good for the first couple of months though and the tea tree oil shampoo with this conditioner helped my hair grown 1 inch a month!
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;Not the best not the worst hair feels good just as the shampoo which is also good would it buy agin no but I will continue to use
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;I ordered this shampoo based on the reviews. I have long hair that goes almost down to my waist and the ends were split ends and dry and felt damaged. After one use with this shampoo my hair felt healthy and revitalized. Not only that it smells great!! I didn't have to use near as much as with drugstore brands such as Pantene and others to be able to cover all my hair and make it feel clean!
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;I expected more from this conditioner.  I thought it would be super moisturizing because of how moisturizing the shampoo was, but I was wrong.
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;It's smooth and smells great.
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;love this brand
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;I've spent almost two decades searching for the best products for my thick, curly hair. It's usually on the dry side and I dye it a few times a year. This conditioner is really and truly a miracle!! My hair has never been softer, lighter, and more manageable than it is now with this. It even helps keep my hair from tangling for a few days after. I couple this with a lightweight curl defining mousse (OGX or Frizz Ease, every other brand I have tried left my curls crunchy and heavy) after my shower and I can rock my natural look without frizz until I wash it again. I recommend mixing a dollop of the conditioner in a spray bottle with water to use for morning touch ups. It smells incredible and keeps my hair under control. Some people said it left residue but it never has with my curls.
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner out there!! It helps with my frizzyness, helps with the softness, and overall leaves my hair looking healthier with each use! The shampoo is a little light, but other than that they're great products!! (Talking about shampoo and conditioner!)
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;I used this shampoo and conditioner and it made my hair very oily. My scalp does tend to be on the oily side, and I had it under control with my previous products but I wanted to try something new and read that this helps with hair growth. I tried it for a couple of weeks because I only shampoo every few days. It just didn't work for me. Made my hair very greasy looking. It will probably work well if you have very dry/damaged hair.
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;Newer formula is less nourishing as it contains more chemicals and less coconut oil, which I suspect is where the old almond scent is originating from. It also leaves hair unmanageable, feeling like straw. After years of using OGX, I now have to find another brand.
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;Love this product
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;I have PCOS and went off my birth control for 2 months and my hair started thinning pretty bad. I'm caucasian and always had thick, long, healthy hair. It was heartbreaking. I tried many products that didn't help or made the fallout worse. I've been using this for about 2 weeks now and I'm beyond grateful for it. My hair looks and feels healthy again. I think it's starting to grow back and I barely lose any hair in the shower now, maybe just 2-3 strands. My dry, sensitive scalp really likes this too. I actually used this shampoo and conditioner back when my hair was at its thickest and longest 2 years ago. After my hunt for something to help with my hair loss, I finally remembered this shampoo and conditioner and how healthy my hair was when I used it in the past. I will always go back to this.
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;The crown of my head has noticeable hair breakage and this conditioner is helping greatly so far.
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;i try alot of shampoos and conditioners, but i always come back to this one. great for sensitive scalps as well.
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;I was shopping for a new hair shampoo/conditioner duo for my thick,curly and frizzy hair. I was looking for something that would eliminate mid day frizz and puffiness and provide the long lasting freshly styled look I was aiming for. Budget is always a factor so that was a huge plus in my decision making while comparing products. My hair needs an extra moisture boost during this time of year in northern MI. The frigid, dry air does not play well with my hair. With all that being said, another factor in my decision was previous reviews. The majority of reviews I read had more pros than cons and overall seemed like a popular vote. For me, being extremely picky and careful of what products I put in my hair, it is saying a lot when I say that I found a winner. This duo is like heaven for my hair and I plan on sticking with it! If you are looking for help with your thick/curly/frizzy/dry strands...give Coconut Miracle Oil conditioner a try and thank me later!
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;Tames the frizz
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;Love the smell.  My hair is very touchable.  Tames the curls.
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;perfect for soft hair
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;hair came out silky
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;I'm broke so I asked the store associate for reccomendqrions. she suggested this. I bought it. I used it. it works very well. the shampoo isn't super Sudsy. I love that. the more suds and bubbles the more damage and stripping of natural oils to your hair. love the product. smells great. doesnt make my hair greasy. I was worried bc I have baby fine yet super duper thick hair. the ends of my hair are super dry. this helped. I followed up with the conditioner and the miracle oil. they're great.
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;I bought this bc I'm broke and cannot afford expensive shampoo right now tbh... a lady in ulta recommended this product. I clutched my pearls because everyone has always told me that this brand is bad for your hair. I'm guessing they have changed their formula up a bit.  this product is actually amazing. smells great. moisturizes the hair. do not expect it to foam up. lots of foam is more damaging and strips hair of it's natural oils anyway.. leaving your hair dry and brittle. I do enjoy this product. if all goes well I might completely make the switch to this brand
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;Great product helps repair hair!!
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;I've been looking for an affordable alternative to my more expensive hair care favorites and I think I'll just have to go back to what I was using before. I wash my hair 1-2 times a week as it is dry and frizzy, and doesn't get oily fast. I was hoping the Coconut Miracle Oil duo would help keep my hair soft, as I need to use a little more product to get good results. My hair was soft for a couple of weeks, but after a couple of washes with this particular range, my hair felt kind of dry and my ends were starting to split. Adding a mask from the same line doesn't help. I think this is okay if you're not picky and have normal, fine hair, it just wasn't for me. It smells really pretty, though, but I don't think there is a lot of oil in this product. Back to the drawing board.
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;it smells great! It makes my hair soft and bouncy and really improved my curl texture! I use this with the conditioner and mousse and so far so good! Would buy again.
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;Leaves my hair soft when used with the conditioner
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;Leaves my hair nice and soft when used the the shampoo
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;"my amazing hairstylist recommended me OGX, and i took it upon myself to pick this rainbow one out, because i LOVE coconut and this was advertised as ""miracle oil"" for my coarse [and sometimes dry] hair. when i used this, it didn't smell like coconut, more like odd plastic-y chemicals. this shampoo also doesn't foam well (if at all), and you have to fight with it to come out of the tube like a gel. because it doesn't foam, i don't get as much coverage on my scalp and thus have to use more than normal. my previous shampoo, garnier fructis (laughably a cheap brand, but at least i'm trying to upgrade my hair game!), i would use a fraction of the amount that i have to use of this OGX 'miracle' shampoo. not happy about this purchase, will not purchase again. also 3x as pricey as fructis if you measure oz for oz. PASS."
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;I bought this conditioner with the shampoo during a trip because I forgot my regular products. I have bleached and dyed my hair for years now, so I'm always looking to add moisture back into my locks. To my surprise, this pair moisturized AND restored a lot of the natural body and texture in my hair. Affordable and effective.
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;This conditioner smells good, like you're in Hawaii! My hair feels so soft and hydrated when I use this. I have fine hair thats relatively thin. It doesnt weigh my hair down at all. I love this with the matching shampoo. Love it!
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;This shampoo smells good, like you're in Hawaii! My hair feels so soft and hydrated when I use this. I have fine hair thats relatively thin. It doesnt weigh my hair down at all. Love it!
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;"The first time I used this my scalp itched. I thought I was having a weird reaction to the coconut oil in this, but it couldn't be because I put raw coconut oil on my hair from time to time and have no itchiness. After I used this a few more times the itchiness sort of stopped, but this doesn't really moisturize my hair. It feels dry down to the ends and sort of frizzy. I'm a ""you buy it, you find some way to use it until it's gone"" kind of person and this is doable when you use a hair mask or hair oil in conjunction with it. It's also sulfate free so that is good for my color treated hair. There seems to be not very many choices for sulfate free products! But I don't think I will buy this again, even though it has a great price."
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;I love the smell of this product except the smell fades within hours of washing. It doesn't lather well until ALOT of product is applied. It also doesn't give the deep scalp clean feeling like other shampoos might however I do like it and think my hair is healthier from using it.
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;Works pretty good gives shine and pretty awsome smell in one week of used ...
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;I really love this stuff. I do wish they made this in much bigger bottles. I also wish they would change the lids on their bottles to a flatter lid so it stood in the shower better when the product is running low. I use 2 bottles of this to 1 shampoo bottle. It really does detangle and add moisture back into my hair. I have really long straight yet wavy hair and it gets extremely dry from the mid shaft down. I always end up using far more conditioner than shampoo in any product I buy. I love this in the winter time and dry climates when my hair needs that extra moisture the most in conjunction with the shampoo and hair oil. It's great for detangling and adds a nice shine. Does nothing for static. But helps to keep my hair moisturized when I really need it the most without feeling greasy or weighed down. I do not get product build up or find that after a while it just doesn't work for me anymore. I really love it. I'm not crazy about vanilla and coconut scents. So I usually use a body mist to cover it up. But a lot of people compliment me on me way it smells when I forget to apply mist. But hands down it works great if you like the smell or not. And it isn't atrusive just not my thing. But it is my go to when I really need the moisture in my hair. I find it far More productive than the Argan oil line in the winter months. But I love the Argan line for summer and humid climates.
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;Great shampoo for the winter months to add some moisture back into my hair. It's a little heavy on my hair in the summer. But it is great for dry climates when I travel or the dry winter air. Wish they would change the lids to flat lids so it is easier to stand up in the shower when the product is running low. I also wish they made this in jumbo bottle sizes. I use this along with the hair oil and conditioner. I have really long hair and my end and middle shaft get very dry. The triple combo helps to keep it from getting brittle. I don't recommend the hair mask with it. I found it to be very drying and counter productive. It actually made my hair worse. I really hate the hair mask. But the shampoo conditioner and hair oil are lovely.
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;My hair was so dry & damaged I think bc I was using the wrong brand! I've always liked OGX products but had switched 2 try some high end ones & none have worked as good as this one. So I'm back on to using this brand's products again. And for the price I'll always continue to buy!
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;Made my hair smoother and did not dry it out.
Extra Strength Damage Remedy + Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo;It smells great, but really REALLY dried my hair out. It causes bad frizz.
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;Spray the light mist into my hair when I'm out of the shower as a.leave in conditioner. Moisturizing to hair when out in the elements..
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;After shampoo while my hair still moist I spray it on, smells delightful and makes my hair soft and fragrant.
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;I use a light mist after shower to hydrate hair. I use this on both wet and dry hair.
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;This is a nice little oil mister.  I like that it is in a spray bottle rather than a pump so it doesn't get all over my hands.  I feel like it distributes the product more evenly with the spray bottle.
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;Love this doesn't make your hair greasy and fixes your dry damaged ends
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;I bought this hoping it would be like my OGX coconut milk but it's not. This is more of an after style oil rather than a post-shower serum which was what i was looking for. that's my fault. however i do feel like i notice more silkiness when using the milk instead of the oil. This does work well after i curl my hair but I never really reach for it
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;I bought this to spray in my hair and keep it hydrated. I use it before I go to sleep and spray all over my hair. When I wake up in the morning my hair is silky smooth, and after I shower I can definitely tell it made my hair texture hydrated. A must have.
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;Purchased last week. Each time I have applied it after washing, conditioning, rinsing, and blow drying my hair, I dont know why, it leaves a weird film on my hair that resembles stringy dandruff on the surface of my hair. Not the least bit appealing! Throwing product away. Very disappointing.
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;I love this product so much! And it's an awesome price.
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;My hair is very dry! I love anything coconut! This smells good throughout the day and makes your hair feel so soft!!
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;I always keep this on hand, along with the Renewing Argan Oil Of Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil. I have very long, color treated hair, and these sprays are great for smoothing right after blow drying, calming frizz on humid days, tames the fly-a-ways, helps to keep my ends healthy, adds shine in a non-greasy way, and as an added bonus-they smell amazing!
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;Smells great! Coconut oil is an essential part of my hair routine..
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;I used this product and I saw a complete transformation on my hair. I sprayed my hair, which are in twist, and the shine! The smell! The hydration of my hair!! Omg!!! I'm obsessed!!
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;This product is a great way to let your hair shine and be so soft! The only thing is I wish it helped with hair growth.
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;I recently bleached my hair for the first time and this has been a game changer for my super dry hair. You don't need the super overpriced oils just spray this on your ends and style your hair as usual this just makes hair soft and shiny. And the husband loves the smell too, so that's a plus.
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;My headline said it all.
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;I have very oily hair, I was worried this spray would make my hair more oily, faster. Yet, a few sprays after air drying my hair then brushing or running my fingers through my hair makes it look great! Less frizz, shinier, silky hair. On the second day after washing my hair, it still looks good without styling and smells so good. I sprayed it on again after my second day without washing and at the end of the day it still looked good! I'll definitely buy it again.
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;This product gives my hair a lot of moisture.
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;I recomend this product. I use it every single day.
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;I totally love this oil mist. I've tried a few other brands and they inevitably leave my hair weighed down and oily. This one is by far the best of the bunch and my favorite daily hair product. My hair and skin tends to be on the drier side which means while I don't have to wash it as often, it also doesn't usually have a nice shine to it. This oil mist adds the shine and softness that I crave and smells wonderful too!
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;I really like this spray! It smells amazing - several reviewers said the smell was overpowering, but I didn't find it to be that way at all. It's definitely noticeable when you first put it on, but throughout the day, you barely notice it. It hydrates, just as it claims, and seems to be a bit of a curl-refresher, too - even though it's an oil.
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;I love this entire brand from their shampoos to the lotion to their hair care products and this one I have bought so many times I can't keep count anymore! Also use it to get off waterproof mascara and works like a charm. Hydrates my frizzy, dry hair and leaves a beautiful shine after straightening. Love, love, love.
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;Moisturizes my natural hair without weighing it down...
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;Love this product it helps my ends hydrated and frizz free. I apply after shower on wet hair and it works wonder. Smells good and no buildup.
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;i have pretty thick hair, and after i wash it it's super frizzy. not when i use this though!! helps so much with after shower dry hair frizz and smells soooo good
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;I spray it on my curls and finger it through.  Works on the frizz.
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;The only downside, for me, is the smell. I'm really not a fan of coconut scented things. That being said, this oil is fantastic for my hair. It's nice and light, but super hydrating.
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;I love this spray on product.  Easy to use for hair and body. My daughter loves it.
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;Left my hair soo smooth!
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;It has a nice smell and is easy to use. I would recommend only using a few sprays and not on the roots of the hair, because it will make your hair look oily. I like other products like this from this company better and will not be buying this again.
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;Not sure what it does?
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;I use this oil along with other OGX oils on my dry ends every night after washing, or every morning on my way out the door. Although the scent is nice, its strong, therefore the scent gets old & overwhelming... fast. My only feedback is that I hope they make an unscented version of the hair spray oil.
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;I like this because its a spray. I typically use Paul Mitchell's Skinny serum but sometimes I need a little shine after my hair has been styled so I need it in a spray form. This is perfect for that. However, the coconut smell can be a bit overwhelming. A little goes a long way and it doesn't weight my hair down.
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;this stuff smells so so good. and it makes my hair look and feel so shiny. i love this stuff and will buy it forever. you should too!!!
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;I love this product because it keeps my hair looking hydrated.  The scent is vanilla /coconut!
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;I reeeally wanted to love this, but it just doesn't work for my hair at all. I have thick, type 3B curly hair and this just made it greasy and frizzy.
Nourishing + Coconut Oil Weightless Hydrating Oil Mist;This fabulous-smelling lightweight oil spray is one of my new favorites. I have thick, wavy hair that tends to be dry and frizzy, that needs a lot of love after washing. After using leave in conditioner and fully drying hair, this is a great spray that doesn't leave hair feeling greasy, but leaves it shiny and moisturized. The smell is my favorite part about it and the main factor in choosing it over other sprays.
FRIZZ FREE + KERATIN SMOOTHING OIL MIRACLE GLOSS SPRAY 6.8 OZ;I gave this product a month to see if it really did anything. Most times, I used it with a heat protecting spray and hence couldn't judge it well. Finally, I decided to just let me hair air dry and used plenty of this product when my hair was damp. I thought my hair would be smooth and have a shine when it dried. Well, NO! My hair was the definition of frizz when it dried. I then tried to straighten my hair and it was difficult to even run the comb through my hair. My hair isn't usually this messy. The product really left a residue which made my hair feel clumpy and dry. I wished I could return this but it was a total waste of money for me.
FRIZZ FREE + KERATIN SMOOTHING OIL MIRACLE GLOSS SPRAY 6.8 OZ;I wanted to try something that would make brushing my hair easier. This product does almost the opposite. To start off the spray bottle was broken and wouldn't spray, so i had to open it and grab some of the product. It made my hair very sticky and harder to brush through. There is also a very strong fragrance that I personally do not like. I would definitely not recommend this product if you want something to detangle your hair!
FRIZZ FREE + KERATIN SMOOTHING OIL MIRACLE GLOSS SPRAY 6.8 OZ;I usually like OGX products but this I couldn't take the smell.
FRIZZ FREE + KERATIN SMOOTHING OIL MIRACLE GLOSS SPRAY 6.8 OZ;Wonderful product
FRIZZ FREE + KERATIN SMOOTHING OIL MIRACLE GLOSS SPRAY 6.8 OZ;This is not an oil based product and the bottle does not spray. You can squirt some product in your hand but you can not spray on your hair to cover an area.  I have curly hair and it did not smooth out my hair because it is not an oil.
FRIZZ FREE + KERATIN SMOOTHING OIL MIRACLE GLOSS SPRAY 6.8 OZ;I bought this and noticed my hair was very dry after using it and I naturally always have very silky hair. I couldn't figure out what it was because I recently changed my shampoo/conditioner but figured out it was this
FRIZZ FREE + KERATIN SMOOTHING OIL MIRACLE GLOSS SPRAY 6.8 OZ;This product left my hair feeling like I had mixed Dry shampoo powder and hair gel together and spread it on thick. I couldn't stand the texture, my hair started getting white build up so I took a fine tooth comb and it was coming out packed full off white waxey product. I had just washed my hair prior to this.
FRIZZ FREE + KERATIN SMOOTHING OIL MIRACLE GLOSS SPRAY 6.8 OZ;I'm returning this item, it made my hair feel extremely weird and it tangled pretty bad. Once I removed it out of my hair routine I knew it was the problem. Definitely would not recommend
FRIZZ FREE + KERATIN SMOOTHING OIL MIRACLE GLOSS SPRAY 6.8 OZ;You get a lot for the price! This leaves your hair looking healthy and shiny, without feeling greasy! The only downside of this is the dispenser, it squirts out to much without being able to spray all over head.
Argan Oil of Morocco Shine & Revitalize Extra Strength Dry Oil Shine Mist;I didn't think I would find an affordable shine spray that I loved more than the sgx nyc shine+repair that I had chosen over this, as the only other ogx product Ive tried was awful. But as much as I loved its natural looking results & buildability, it also meant I had to use a lot after blow drying or brushing my waist length hair, giving 1 bottle only around 3 weeks & still not reaching my desired shine. So I went for this one next. Same price for more effective product, more amount of it, equal non oily weightlessness & less needed! W/o the chemical fragrance to boot. A couple sprays gives more shine, flyaway/frizz fix, & lasting softness than I've ever known. My thick longhair tangles easy always, and it was so soft+smooth w/slip it didn't tangle itself & I could run my fingers through it all day. #1 shine spray hands down. Will be more open to ogx from now on.
Argan Oil of Morocco Shine & Revitalize Extra Strength Dry Oil Shine Mist;This smells amazing and absorbs oil. It's a dry shampoo that adds volume. It doesn't add a ton of shine so I'm not sure why shine is in the name. It is comparable to the dry bar brand at a fraction of the cost. I would recommend it.
Argan Oil of Morocco Shine & Revitalize Extra Strength Dry Oil Shine Mist;This product smells so amazing! I feel like the smells stays in my hair for a good few hours and is very lightweight. However, I don't know if I can say that it adds that much shine to be honest. If you're looking for more of a hair fragrance, I think you'd like this. If you want actual shine, you may want to look elsewhere.
Argan Oil of Morocco Shine & Revitalize Extra Strength Dry Oil Shine Mist;This product smells amazing but it doesn't seem to do much for providing shine.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Shampoo;I used this shampoo and the conditioner for about a month and I think it may be somewhat effective in thickening/volumizing (hard to tell, i've had hair loss from nutritional deficiencies and it may just have improved separately while i used this product) but my scalp really did not like it. After a wash or 2 my scalp was so dry and flaking off EVERYWHERE. I wanted to see if it was just a phase my hair was going through, since i've had flakiness in the past, but the more i used this shampoo the worse it got. it smells nice, and like i said, it may do something for fullness. but the scalp situation makes it not worth it for me. the search continues.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Shampoo;Like the feel of it.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Shampoo;This shampoo may not be as foamy and easy to apply compared to other shampoos but the benefits outweigh any of that. I had been rapidly losing hair for months in alarming quantities. After a month of using this my hair loss decreased dramatically and I noticed my hair breakage was less as well. I switched to a different shampoo and the breakage returned but since coming back the biotin one it's getting stronger again. This stuff honestly saved me from so much panic, cannot recommend more.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Shampoo;Looking for a shampoo that didn't cost an arm and a leg. Found this on an aisle rack and thought I'd give it a try. I love that the shampoo is such a nice think product. It lathers up quickly and does a terrific job of cleaning my hair. Smells wonderful too!  Thought with the Ciotin and Collegen would be helpful to my fragile hair. Only been using it for a week now so can't let you know if it's helped just yet. I'm looking forward to this being a keeper kind of shampoo
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Shampoo;First time trying this. Looked at a lot of other products, this one sounded good from the reviews. I liked the thickness of the shampoo, it wasn't watery.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Shampoo;I use this daily followed by ITS A 10 for blondes! My stylist asked me what I had been doing to my hair! She couldn't believe how thick it appeared!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Shampoo;Have not seen a difference yet
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Shampoo;I liked this shampoo but didn't get to see if it really worked because after about a week I started to breakout around my hairline and had to switch to something else for it to go away
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Shampoo;Sadly even though this smells amazing! this dried my hair out so bad! My hair felt like the life was sucked out of it
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Shampoo;I used Nioxin for about 3 months. I did get compliments about my hair looking thicker but it left my hair extremely dry and frizzy. The first day after using this, I received the same compliments but also was told my hair looked healthier! Definitely using this instead, plus I'm saving a lot of money!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Shampoo;I wash my hair every other day and use this as well as the conditioner.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Shampoo;Thanks to hormone and medicine changes, I was having a ton of hair loss and breakage.  My hair was getting thinner and thinner.  Got this to help strengthen my hair.  Hair loss has gone back to normal amounts and my hair is no longer breaking.  I've also got a ton of baby hairs growing back in.  I can feel them on my scalp like a blanket of peach fuzz.  Really helps.  Plus, the formula has a water soluable silicone which makes it a good choice.  The standard version of this shampoo has dimethicone which is not water soluable.  Glad this one is usable for me!
Protecting + Silky Blowout Quick Drying Thermal Spray;"I was trying to find something to replace the L'Oréal blow dry spray since it is being discontinued, and this is NOT it. It made my hair very dry and crunchy. It definitely does not give you a ""silky blowout"" at all"
Protecting + Silky Blowout Quick Drying Thermal Spray;This product really works!  It cuts drying time and smells absolutely amazing!  I'm taking off one star only for the pump.  It sprays out in a stream rather than a mist, so I have to spray it into my hands and rub it in.
Protecting + Silky Blowout Quick Drying Thermal Spray;i tried this for a couple months on my platinum blonde hair, and it BURNT it straight off when heat was applied! i've never had products do this before and i haven't changed the heat setting so i was so disappointed. i ended up having to trim a lot of fried ends off. don't waste your money!!
Protecting + Silky Blowout Quick Drying Thermal Spray;I wanted to love this given the great reviews but this made my hair look extremely dried out and staticy. I have very fine straight hair so this usually is never an issue for me but using this in combination with Olaplex definitely canceled out the amazing benefits of olaplex and made my hair look very dull and dry. It smells absolutely amazing though!
Protecting + Silky Blowout Quick Drying Thermal Spray;I am beyond thankful for this product. I was not given a free product for review or anything. I purchased this on my own and was extremely doubtful of what it could do for me. I went into this like this stuff isn't going to work like every other product and I was WRONG. This product actually does what it says it will do. I have very curly hair and anytime I'm gonna straighten it, I spray this by itself right onto my hair (two maybe three sprays is enough) and after a few days of it being straight, it's silky smooth bouncy curls again. I could not believe it. I'm really surprised but also extremely thankful because it's been a challenge to find products that actually do what they say they will. :)
Protecting + Silky Blowout Quick Drying Thermal Spray;I cant say it does the best job, but it does detangle and has a good smell. I don't like how it sprays out. I prefer more of a mist then a straight spraying.
Protecting + Silky Blowout Quick Drying Thermal Spray;My hair is fine so I spray product in my hand and work through hair so I don't get too much in one place. It protects my hair from heat and helps it feel smooth without weighing it down
Protecting + Silky Blowout Quick Drying Thermal Spray;I am returning this ! I keep my hair as conditioned and as healthy as possible because I've bleached my hair, I don't like to blow dry my hair too often, unless I'm going somewhere,  I used this as directed,  and this stuff caused damage to my hair! My ends got dry and britle!
Protecting + Silky Blowout Quick Drying Thermal Spray;I spray it on my damp hair and then blow dry.  I have noticed this product gives my hair so much static it's unreal.
Protecting + Silky Blowout Quick Drying Thermal Spray;I've tried so many heat protectants! Lotions&sprays from high end brands to low budget ones. This is the best one for the price. It even beats the redken one I just tried.  This made my hair feel so soft, shiny, my hair laid nicely and basically it fixed all my hair flaws and made it easier to manage. It's very light weight. I use about 8 pumps my hair is medium length& let my hair air dry 80% then blow dry and poof great hair!
Protecting + Silky Blowout Quick Drying Thermal Spray;I like this product because it doesn't make your hair s m o k e < -(the only way I could type it without getting flagged which is dumb) like other products I've used and it works well. The only con I can find is that it doesn't dry fast like it says it should but it's still a great product I will continue to use.
Protecting + Silky Blowout Quick Drying Thermal Spray;I bought this item here because it indicates level 3 on the bottle pictured. But it came as level 1 which was disappointing. I've already used level 1 once before and I absolutely love the smell, however, looked forward to that level 3 as well as a better spray bottle. I not sure if this is all bottles but this sprays way too direct. needs a spayer that disperses product better.
Protecting + Silky Blowout Quick Drying Thermal Spray;I have
Protecting + Silky Blowout Quick Drying Thermal Spray;Sprayed in, combed through and started drying my hair.
Protecting + Silky Blowout Quick Drying Thermal Spray;I spray on my wet fine wavy hair before blow drying.  It gives me volume and shine and my style lasts for days with no greasy feeling.  Got tons of compliments on how healthy my hair looked!
Protecting + Silky Blowout Quick Drying Thermal Spray;It smells so great and definitely helps reduce drying time. Makes my hair feel and smell great too
Protecting + Silky Blowout Quick Drying Thermal Spray;On my quest to find a product that cuts drying time for my dense long hair, had heard about this brand so I tried it after finishing my Eva NYC Mane Magic. As for time saving is good but leaves my hair feeling kind of stiff, not sure if I will continue to use it.
Protecting + Silky Blowout Quick Drying Thermal Spray;Love it will buy it again.
Protecting + Silky Blowout Quick Drying Thermal Spray;My main reason for buying is the overall reason for the product, to help decrease my hair drying time. I have long, thick hair, and normally it takes me about 20 minutes to dry my hair. After using this product I have noticed it has cut down my drying time to 10 minutes. Some other added benefits I've found is that it makes my hair softer, shiny, and lighter. The smell is also great. Some things I don't like are the bottle shape which makes it harder to spray the product and that it sprays as a stream and not a mist. That's why I'm giving it 4/5 stars.
Protecting + Silky Blowout Quick Drying Thermal Spray;I really this spray. It smells really good and makes my hair shiny and soft. I just wish it sprayed in a mist rather than a stream
Protecting + Silky Blowout Quick Drying Thermal Spray;Bought this as I'm growing my hair out and need to start blow drying in the AM. I have about shoulder length hair, that previously had minimal breakage and has never been dyed. I used this product as directed and didn't notice any negative effects until after I blow dried and started to straighten my hair. I watched as strang after strand frizzled and snapped. My part is seriously ruined with all the breakage. It may be helpful if all you do is blow dry, but any heat styling after that I'd be seriously cautious of.
Protecting + Silky Blowout Quick Drying Thermal Spray;Bought this to try as a less expensive alternative to Kendra blow out spray. Did not like at all, left my hair very stiff and feeling of alot of product in my hair. I usually go a day or two without washing my hair but after using this I had to wash it the next day.
Protecting + Silky Blowout Quick Drying Thermal Spray;This stuff is amazing.  This is my 2nd bottle.  Works great!  Smells SO GOOD!
Pracaxi Oil Deeply Restoring Recovery Combing Cream;using this really helps my wavy and frizzy hair calm down. you don't have to use much. i am still on a bottle of it from october. in addition it smells amazing!!
Pracaxi Oil Deeply Restoring Recovery Combing Cream;Purchased this without reading the description... I have tape in hair extensions so I CANT use conditioner in the shower so my hair becomes super dry, coarse, dull and impossible to comb through when blow drying! I use just about a quarter sized amount of the product in my palms and run it through my hair staring at the ends and BOOM my hair is super soft without being weighed down and looking oily. Blow drying it becomes a breeze and no more stingy knots! I find this product to be better Than the expensive Living Proof restore perfecting  spray! I will forever have this item as part of my hair care routine!
Pracaxi Oil Deeply Restoring Recovery Combing Cream;I wish I would have bought it before. It moistures and untangles hair, hair also feels softer after use and leaves my curls looking great.
Pracaxi Oil Deeply Restoring Recovery Combing Cream;I would recommend this product to people who enjoy leave in conditioners. It has a nice light scent, leaves hair very manageable and a little product goes a long way. I was using the Garnier leave in conditioner but this product is much better.
Pracaxi Oil Deeply Restoring Recovery Combing Cream;Bomb as a leave in for 3c/4a hair + Camille rose curl maker
Pracaxi Oil Deeply Restoring Recovery Combing Cream;I have 3b-c curly hair and this product makes detangling easier.
Pracaxi Oil Deeply Restoring Recovery Combing Cream;I have 4C low porosity hair and was having difficulty retaining moisture. This product is amazing. It moisturizes my hair without weighing it down.
Pracaxi Oil Deeply Restoring Recovery Combing Cream;I like the OGX smell, but the fragrance of this cream I absolutely LOVE. It smells like one of my expensive perfumes, which gradually fades but a hint is still notable throughout the day. Someone just complimented how I smelled it's pretty amazing. It smells like it Sol De Janeiro's sweet scent mixed with OGX classic scent, so balanced. Now, in terms of formula it is thick and easily spreads through the hair, dries down like a soft gel with actual hold. No flakes. I bought two with the discount and I am so excited to use over the summer, it's a total summer vibe in the packaging, scent and luxurious formula. I will be restocking throughout the year as it serves my needs of a) restoring my bleach blond hair, and b) having enough grip to act as a hair mask or gel, c) the shine it gives is, d) reasonable price and quantity, e) beautiful scent! It's like my hair mask & hair gel dreams!
Pracaxi Oil Deeply Restoring Recovery Combing Cream;I use this product right after I towel dry my hair after a shower- It leaves my hair so soft and smooth and it is not crunchy! I have been searching for a product that doesn't leave my hair crunchy or weighted down, and with this product I found that! The smell is wonderful, and my hair looks shiny and healthy after using this. I have super frizzy and curly hair and this was perfect for it! I will definitely be buying again!
Pracaxi Oil Deeply Restoring Recovery Combing Cream;I have fine, curly hair, I thought this would be too heavy for my hair but it's not! And it smells delicious. I can see this working for most hair curly hair types.  My hair isn't frizzy, and also not greasy after I use this. I will be repurchasing.
Pracaxi Oil Deeply Restoring Recovery Combing Cream;"I have tried so many products for my hair (3b/3c). It either isn't moisturizing enough, leaves residue, or feels ""crunchy"". I bought this on a whim and am so glad. It smells amazing, and everytime I use it, I get the same amazing results. I don't have to worry about my hair drying differently than I like AND my hair feels so soft with this! Like I just used a hair mask. Does not leave a residue or build up. I am really happy with this and think I found my holy grail curly hair product!!"
Pracaxi Oil Deeply Restoring Recovery Combing Cream;Really like this. It's moisturizing and helps enhance your waves or curls!
TEATREE MINT XS CONDITIONER;The combination of tea tree oil and mint smells so clean and fresh, using this shampoo after a hot, sweaty day leaves my scalp tingling and I feel energized.
TEATREE MINT XS CONDITIONER;I love the shampoo and the conditioner goes a long way, the only thing is that I'm not a huge fan of how it makes my hair feel afterwards. It's definitely drying, but a serum can help that. I rotate how many times a I wash my hair with this.
TEATREE MINT XS CONDITIONER;I don't know what type of conditioner this is supposed to be but my hair didn't feel conditioned. I've used clarifying shampoos that aren't as drying as this. I couldn't even comb through my hair with the conditioner in it I had to wait until the next morning when it dried to detangle it. Definitely will be returning.
TEATREE MINT XS CONDITIONER;Love this product. A little goes along way! Gets the job done!
TEATREE MINT XS CONDITIONER;The shampoo was really nice but this conditioner was not. It made my hair feel rough and it made alot of my hair fall out when i rinsed it out. Very dissappointed, i really wanted to like it because i love minty stuff.
TEATREE MINT XS CONDITIONER;This has stopped my boyfriends head from itching and flaking! Whereas it has not taken it away completely it has kept it from being noticeable and irritated.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I have been using this product for a few months & have lost so much hair since I have been using. I did not think it was related to the product until I did some research.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I've been using this product for several months, and it left my hair in worse condition than before.  It's way too soft -- and fly-away!  None of which is an improvement over no conditioner at all.  The only good thing I experienced with this product is the fragrance -- if it was a product that did even the minimum of what any conditioner should do, I would buy it just for the fragrance.  Too bad, because I love other OGX products.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;It'll make your hair feel full and give volume, but at the same time it'll weigh it down. Your hair will become oily, and be due for a wash compared to normal time.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I bought this shampoo hoping I could achieve more thick and voluminous hair. However, after using this product only 2 times it left a waxy/sticky coat over my hair and actually made me loose hair. I have never used a product that made me loose so much hair especially if it claims to strengthen your hair
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;As a conditioner
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;i am so disappointed that a product I have used forever has changed. I noticed no difference in shampoo. But this new formula for the conditioner is just sad. totally dries out hair as if theres no conditioner in it at all. My first clue was it was not squeezing out of the bottle right. It actually tangles my hair leaving it hard now and not soft and easy to get a wide tooth comb through this thin hair. I am so disappointed and am going to have to change brands. I pulled out a sample bottle and then this. The ingredient's are switched around and some changed. I am going to have to throw away a bottle 3/4 full. I used so much last night to try to make it work and its still horrid.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Not sure if this is a bad bottle, but I have a heck of a time getting product out of container, and when I do, its just a blob and it doesn't lather up.  Not to impressed at this point.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I was surprised I liked this shampoo and conditioner so much. I think the people who didn't like it probably were using it every time they washed their hair. I alternate with a higher quality shampoo and conditioner (lanza and a purple shampoo) and I've never had a problem with build up. Im obsessed with the smell! I can go to bed with my hair wet and just brush it in the morning and it looks like I just had a blow out.  Is this the best shampoo and conditioner for the health of your hair? Probably not.. but its a good one to have in the shower for the days you want something different.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Smells absolutely awful, would NOT recommend!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;"This is the strangest shampoo (and the conditioner) to me. I am used to shampoos that feel frothy and rich, and conditioners that feel silky when I rinse them out. I do a lot of detangling with my fingers in the shower because my hair is so long. It's well past my waist, almost to the top of my legs. Finger detangling in the shower helps prevent a lot of breakage. This shampoo (and the conditioner) scared me at first. I could hardly get my fingers through my hair. It knotted up when I shampooed, and took forever to get the knots out. The shampoo seemed to completely strip my hair, or so it felt. I'm talking SQUEEEEEAKY clean. I assumed that when it dried, it would look like a broom. But it didn't. I also used the conditioner, which didn't give me a warm fuzzy feeling, either. I didn't use any detangler or hair oil out of the shower because I wanted to see exactly how this stuff worked for me. I carefully detangled with a flat detangling brush and let it air dry. And it looked amazing! I was shocked. My hair was so shiny and soft. It had lots of movement, and my waves had definition. I've used about half of both bottles so far, and I'm not seeing any change. My hair doesn't seem to be drying out or breaking, and I haven't noticed any unusual hair fall. I'm still on the fence, though, because it's so difficult to detangle. The ""after"" is great for me. It's getting there that's difficult, and I don't like spending ages on my hair. I want to wash, detangle, and let it air dry on its own."
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Great product!! Loved it! Give a heavy hair look. happy with purchase.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I recently cut my waist-length hair off to about my jawline, and was seriously concerned about volume. My hair has always been super thin, so when I chopped it off, I was instantly on the hunt for a good voluming shampoo. I work at Ulta and despite my employee discount, I'm not a fan of dropping a ton of money on shampoos because I like to mix mine to get various benefits. OGX has worked great for me in the past and I love that it's cruelty free and very affordable. While this shampoo in particular doesn't smell the ~best~ it works AMAZING. My hair has gotten some SERIOUS volume since I've started using it and I've found myself using less volumizing styling products just because I don't want my hair to look poofy! Can't say I've had to deal with that before! Overall, I totally recommend and will plan on getting this again once I run out!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;So far I love it
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;This made my hair feel dry and as if there was a coat of sticky wax covering it - will not be buying again
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I have used several different kinds of shampoo and this one made my thin post postpartum hair thick and healthy
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;After trying this product for two months, I'm going tomorrow to get my long hair cut off at my neck because it feels like straw, is breaking, and falling out.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I read the other reviews about the DMDM in this that causes hair loss. After using this shampoo my hair falls out, is dry and brittle. Looking at the ingredients on Ulta's website, the DMDM is not listed. On the bottle in my shower it's listed plain as day!! Why didn't ulta include it on their ingredients?! That's shady.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;This shampoo knotted my hair up so bad, and I experienced so much hair loss. Honestly while I was using it I never thought anything of it until i seen that other people were experiencing the same issue, it also dried out my hair. Never will purchase this again!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;The best product ever if you have damaged hair
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I've been using this for about 2 years, thinking it was good for my hair. WRONG! It has DMDM Hydantoin as well as other ingredients that DAMAGE your hair and cause HAIR LOSS! As a 27-yr old experiencing hair loss, this is not okay!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I decided to try this after reading an article rating shampoos for thin hair, (this was the reasonably priced option) and boy I'm sure glad I did! My very fine, very thin hair seems thicker and fuller after only about a week of daily washing! It also does not seem to be drying like other shampoos I've tried. I was very skeptical, but this has certainly lived up to it's recommendation. I definitely recommend it.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Unfortunately I used this for years since it's sulfate and paraben free. However it has DMDM hydantoin!!! This is no better than using tresemme. Look up the lawsuits and save your hair. I switched to hempz shampoo and conditioner
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;My husband used this product, and his scalp was very irritated.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I started noticing hair loss after a few times using this shampoo and conditioner. At the time I didnt think none of it until my shower got clogged. When I unclogged it and seen the amount of hair I lost I wanted to cry. I immediately threw the product away and stopped using it. I then googled what causes hair loss and seen that this product contains DMDM hydantoin and sodium chloride. Which both ingredients are bad for your scalp & causes hair loss.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I used it for 3 times now. It's really good shampoo. The only negative thing - the smell is too strong.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I can't honestly rate this for how it works but I will tell you if you don't like that fake coconut smell that smells like a car air freshener, you will hate this smell.  It's just like it.  Must return.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;After using the shampoo and conditioner for only one week, my hair has so much volume and looks healthy!  I am not losing hair as I was before.  So impressed with this product!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;This product smells great and leaves my hair soft
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I've been using this shampoo for a few weeks now, because I wanted my hair to feel thicker and more voluminous. The first few times I used it, I thought my hair looked super shiny and clean. As I've continued to use it, I've noticed a drastic REDUCTION in my hair's volume. My hair is so limp and feels incredibly thin now. The shampoo smells good and it does make my hair shiny, but it is not worth all the fall out!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;So I tried switching to different shampoos and conditioners to see differences, and I always go back to this!! The only shampoo and conditioner that leaves my hair so soft and healthy feeling. My hair grew the longest when I used this. Will always stick with it!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Seriously like food for my hair!! Thankful & please do not change formula or do anything with this product! Life changing!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I purchased this after seeing thousands of great reviews of several sites. I question if the reviews are legit because this stuff is terrible! The shampoo along with the conditioner will dry out your hair! My hair was so dry, coarse and difficult to straighten with a straightener after using this. Usually after shampooing and conditioning, your hair immediately becomes softer and you can run your fingers through it. I couldn't run my fingers through my hair at all in the shower with the conditioner that goes along with this shampoo. The texture / fragrance of this stuff reminds me of something you'd find at a cheap discount store. It is not worth the price. I am throwing both bottles out and purchasing new ones because it is ruining my hair!!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Dried my hair out severely and made it start falling out! I've always been super self conscious of my thin hair and now it's worse than before. So disappointed.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I wash my hair twice a week while it stays full and soft and  feeling good with how my hair feels.  With what I was using left a coating and flats on my hair and I lost more hair.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;"I honestly am torn between liking and disliking this product. The shampoo and conditioner does what it's labeled to do, my hair is noticeable thicker and has more texture. However, it's almost thick to the point where it has lost all natural shape and bounce and just wants to poof out like a box around my head. It's almost crunchy. On top of that, the product leaves a waxy film on your hair and on your skin that is impossible to rinse out completely. I guess that's what makes your hair feel ""thicker""? It smells really strong too, like reallyyyy strong. I like the smell because it reminds me of warm vanilla sugar, but sensitive users beware. Like I said, does the job, but due to its quirks I will not be repurchasing."
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I bought this shampoo and conditioner desperately looking for something to help me with my rapidly thinning hair.  My hair has gotten so thin that I can see my scalp throughout it so I was hoping to find a product to help add volume.  At first the product was really helping my hair look great, and then I started to notice a film being left on my scalp after showering no matter how well I rinsed my hair.  This film made my hair feel grimy and my scalp was itchy....so the search for a perfect shampoo and conditioner continues.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Where has this been my whole life!!! It smells amazing, my hair feels so much thicker, shinier, so soft and not frizzy at all. I love love love this formula.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Smells nice but made my hair feel incredibly dry. I have tried other organix products and loved them but the collagen ones just dry out my hair for some reason.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;i was a little sceptical about trying it because of all the bad reviews but i figured hey why not my hair was already falling out ALOT and i mean literal bunches of hair i was so depressed about it and decided to give it a try let me tell you i was so happy to see only a couple hairs go down the drain after i showered i also noticed it helped with the itching on my scalp i was so sick of using head and shoulders it made my hair stink! this one smells sweet like vanilla :) the only bad thing is it does make your hair dry so i use the ogx coconut serum for that  , other than that i love how full my hair feels now and also how much it stopped falling out
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I used this shampoo religiously for two or three years now. I loved the smell and it gave good softness and volume to my thin, fine hair. I recently noticed more and more of my hair falling out in the shower and began to fear the worst, like a hormone issue, until I happened to read a review for this shampoo and everyone else was mentioning hair loss. Put it in the trash immediately and moved on to a new brand and the hair loss is slowly stopping but it's going to be a long journey to get it back to normal.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;This shampoo turned into gel after two weeks! It's super sticky now and can't be washed out of my hair. It was even hard to get off of my hands. The first few uses were good but i had to throw it away after only a few weeks
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I was using this shampoo and conditioner for a while because I have fine hair, and lack of volume, so it seemed like a great solution! I started using it for a few months and noticed the hair appeared to be thicker, and slightly more voluminous. However, shortly after, I got my hair colored and bought some salon quality shampoo and conditioner to protect the color and used that. Flash Forward, the salon hair product is gone and I switch back to this product. I didn't think anything of it at first, I noticed my hair didn't feel as soft but wasn't too bothered by it. A few days of using it and I'm noticing my hair will not stop getting greasy by the end of the day! With the salon product I could easily go two maybe three days without washing, with this product I can barely go one. It's irritating for me because I'm not sweating profusely or working out in any way. The only difference is this shampoo/conditioner. Also I've notice it's difficult to run my fingers through my hair, as well as to brush it, And I definitely have an increase of tangles and knots. Like others have mentioned, it must be product build up in the hair. The other let down is the  conditioner formula is really thin and barely feels like it moisturizes my hair at all, somehow it feels more stripped of moisture after using it in the shower. honestly had it not been for my Salon product experience I might not have never noticed but I'm glad I did!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;"Have used for a long time. Definitely helps hair look and feel more full. Not a new formula. There was an additional Biotin kind that OGX launched called ""Extra Strength"" or something, but this Thick and Full Biotin one looks to still be the same."
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I have thick wavy hair that is naturally very soft and manageable. This shampoo and conditioner made it impossible to brush through or do anything with, and it left a sticky residue. My hair was very dry but greasy at the roots, and my hair feels a lot thinner than when I started using it.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Got this because it seemed to have good ingredients. Biotin, collagen, vitamins, etc. Is sold as sulfate free but the third ingredient is a sulfate. I use this product like I've used others and after using this my scalp is always itching, I'm starting to get flakes, and normally I wash my hair 2 times a week but since using this, I can't be the day after washing my hair is insanely oily. Idk what the issue is with this company and their products but I've had the same problem when I used their keratin shampoo a few years ago.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;This left a heavy film on my hair that made it feel nasty and unmanageable. My hair started falling out because of this. I threw this and the shampoo in the trash.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;This shampoo and conditioner stripped my hair.  My hair is naturally dry, anyway, and it took 3 months to restore it (let is grow out). I keep my hair short.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I couldn't figure out why my hair felt so terrible the past few weeks. Usually, it is smooth and doesnt take much to detangle. I thought there was something wrong with me, until I realized I had recently started using this conditioner. I threw it out, used a Wella conditioner last night instead, and my hair is back to normal, although now I have breakage  due to how much I had to comb through knots in my hair because of this conditioner. Skip this one people, save your hair
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Used the OGX Thick and Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo for YEARS, and it made a huge difference to improve the thickness of my hair. But the ingredients are now different, and... just no. Not the same. In the history of cosmetics and hair products, I've only ever encountered 2 products that were truly improved when the ingredients changed. This was not one of those 2 products. I'm not looking forward to the annoyance of finding a new shampoo.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;i like that this shampoo is sulfate free, i don't think it did anything for thickness, and the fragrance is a bit too strong but smells nice
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Love the smell, love the feel afterwards, less frizzy and easier to manage. LOVE THIS!!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Replay I feel different when only one use
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Please use caution with this shampoo. I had used OGX brand products in the past (Argan Oil), and never had issues. However, about a week into using this shampoo and conditioner I noticed a large amount of hair fall and actually noticed several completely bald spots on my head. It made my hair extremely dry, tangled, and unmanageable. I know some people love it and have no issues, but I really wish I would have read more reviews before using. I'm now devastated and trying to grow my hair back.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I was excited to try this da shampoo and conditioner because I have had good experiences with other products from this brand, however I am not impressed with this one. It made my hair feel very waxy/greasy and dried my ends out quite a bit. I have fine hair strands, but thick hair overall. It weighed my hair down rather than adding volume. Might work for other hair types but not mine particularly.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Ever since I discovered this product shampoo and conditioner in my local supermarket, that's all I ever use now. I leave a tad bit conditioner in my hair for manageability after I wash my hair. My hair is so soft and full looking. I've gotten many compliments how healthy my hair looks. Great Product !! Thanks
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;This conditioner is very thin and has barely any slip which made detangling my curly hair very hard, I gave it two stars because it did make my hair grow faster because of the biotin but it is very drying, as soon as I step out of the shower my hair feels silicone-e and it definitely made my hair frizzier.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;This product is literally the best. My hair started falling a lot and I'm only 22 and I had no idea why. I started investing in all these hair shampoos for thinning hair like purador and Moroccan oil shampoo but they all made my hair fall in clumps. There was so much hair in the drain. My friend told me to buy the ogx biotin shampoo and conditioner and let me tell you, the results were amazing! After one use there was literally 2 strands of hair in the drain when I was done. And the best thing is you only need a drop. A little goes a long way. It definitely helped my itchy dry scalp and I can feel my hair getting thicker. YOU GUYS MUST TRY!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Beware- this will make your hair fall out in CLUMPS in the shower. Will never use again!!!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I swear by OGX conditioner. Even when I treat my hair with heat every day, this helps keep the split ends away. It's always surprising to my hair stylist how I have almost no split ends.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I used Nioxin for about 3 months. I did get compliments about my hair looking thicker but it left my hair extremely dry and frizzy. The first day after using this, I received the same compliments but also was told my hair looked healthier! Definitely using this instead, plus I'm saving a lot of money!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Looking for a new shampoo. Not much better than what I used already.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Was recommended by a friend but doesn't work for me. Needed to use another product to get the tangles out and moisturize
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I see a lot of people asking about what kind of scent this is all the time, and it states that it is a floral. Could be true, but I would compare it smelling to Aquolina pink sugar perfume, or sugar Scentsy bar. One of the reasons I use this shampoo, is for the awesome scent!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Not recommended for curly/course hair
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I wanted to give this product a try because I was loosing hair by the hand fulls and my hair is getting very thin. After just the first few uses I notice no lose of hair my hair was smooth and soft. The more I use it I'm noticing it getting frizzy but only loose a few strands vs a ton. I will continue to use this shampoo and conditioner.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I used this multiple times & was never able to fully wash it out ever. It leaves my hair with a waxy residue that makes it impossible to run my fingers through or brush easily. It is therefore prone to tangling and breaking. I normally have fine, smooth, and somewhat slippery hair & while this product gave the appearance of volume, it was simply product buildup making the strands appear thicker. Would not recommend, I am throwing out the remaining product.

Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Been buying this shampoo since summer. Keeps your hair full & moisturized. Smells great!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I have damaged hair due to bleaching it over 8yrs. I recently went brunette. I've been looking for a shampoo to help with my hair. My hair is damaged and feels frizzy and dry. After reading the reviews on here, I wanted to give it a try. Let me tell youC best thing ever! My hair was soft after getting out of the shower. I didn't even struggle to brush my hair. I totally recommend it if you have damaged hair. If it doesn't work out for you, you can always return it.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I use this shampoo every day.  It is the best I have used as far as keeping my hair stronger and healthier
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;And i used to use it a lot. But yeah if you just want your hair to smell delicious buy it.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I've received comments and noticed the thickness and shine
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;"Honestly, I had high hopes for this shampoo.  After using it, I noticed my head itching.  Then I started to feel bumps.  At first I thought ""maybe it's something else"", so I tried a different shampoo for a few days.  My scalp got better.  Went back to this shampoo/conditioner and the bumps are back and my head itches."
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;"""Dimethicone (which is in this product) is used as a sealant against water and even air. It is not a natural ingredient, and its side effects are bad for our hair. It gives the hair the illusion of shine, but it is not the shine we want—it is a fake shine from the plastic."" DO NOT BUY!"
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;my hair has grown so much since i started using this shampoo in the summer. 10 times out of 10 if my friends haven't seen me in two weeks they always comment on how my hair has gotten even longer since they've seen me! but also note my hair is healthy and i have rarely used heat in about a year. so not sure the effects on damaged hair
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I wash my hair 2-3 a week.  The crown of my head has noticeable breakage and this shampoo is helping alleviate that.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;This hasn't really done anything for my hair. It's fine as a conditioner, but I dont think it's a great choice if you're trying to repair damage.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;My hair was falling in bulk really bad and I read this shampoo was good so I decided to give it a try and iam really happy with the results. I had 2 bald spots on my head and hair is starting to grow back again...
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I tried out the shampoo and conditioner as my sister had just bought it and the reviews seemed very promising but this DRIED MY HAIR OUT SO BAD! My hair has never felt or looked more dehydrated and frizzy. I will say they both smelled very nice and felt hydrating while I had used them in the shower but I did not like the way my hair dried at all. Very disappointed.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I want to love this shampoo simply because of the smell, but everytime i wash, it leaves my hair dull and greasy. I thought maybe it was just when I blow dried, but even after letting it air dry, it looked terrible. It always feels like the stuff isn't fully washed out every.single.time. It's so frustrating!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;This is literally the worst conditioner I've ever used. It leaves so much build up on my hair, it makes me cringe. It feels like I didn't wash the conditioner out, and I stood in the shower EXTRA to make sure I got it all out. The reason people think that this gives them volume is because it just leaves build up on your hair! Avoid this product like the plague.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I used this in conjunction with the shampoo. I found that my hair looks thicker and fuller. conditioner makes my hair feel very soft and helps with tangles.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Does what it says. Leaves hair looking fuller and thicker.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Light weight and takes a small amount to use. Make my hair softer and easier to comb after washing my hair.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Inexpensive and works great
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;After just 3 to 4 washes I can tell the difference. I've used biometrix full density and OGX works 10x better
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;These shampoo and conditions are the best.  Safe for color treated and keratin treated hair.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Smells great! Leaves my hair soft & manageable.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I have two large drawerfuls of shampoo and conditioner. I'm always on the hunt for a shampoo that will tame my frizzy hair but not make it flat. This shampoo not only leaves my hair looking healthy but leaves my hair looking full and thick
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I have naturally straight, thin, fine hair and I have been using this shampoo for about a week now and my hair definitely feels fuller and thicker. I personally alternate every other wash using a normal shampoo because I don't want my hair to become too full and thick. Highly recommend for those with thin hair!!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Literally the best shampoo ever! I was experiencing serious fall outs, horrible! Was looking for a good shampoo and saw this on the shelf at Ulta. I have tried really expensive ones and never got the result I was looking for- promises of soft, shiny and etc. never happened with other ones. This biotin shampoo and conditioner not only leaves my hair sooo soft - living in humid Texas- but also has reduced the fall outs drastically. By drastically I mean if I was loosing 100 hair a day now it is like 10 a day. I hope it stays the same for my hair and scalp. I ordered two more of the big ones. Thanks for the great product. Hope it helps other people. Btw my hair is colored and my husband is also enjoying this shampoo and conditioner.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I have thin hair, and I love using the shampoo/conditioner combo because it leaves my hair looking thick.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Love the smell of this shampoo. Leaves my hair looking beautiful.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I really like this shampoo/conditioner combo. Great smell, keeps my hair tamed and voluminous. I am a biolage fiend but I couldnt justify the price for them anymore. For jumbo sizes OGX is affordable for my budget and even better durring the Jumbo Shampoo & Conditioner sale. I like using this and then blowdrying my hair after with their OGX thermal protector silk blowout cream.

Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Smells like literal heaven. I cannot stop smelling it. BUT after i wash my hair with it, i can't smell it on my hair hours later like i can with other shampoos which makes me sad.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I love this   Conditioner  It works so well it's great for fine hair
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I have tried matrix, kenra, and redken. You wont find anything else that will give you more volume than this one.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;The shampoo made my hair really soft, but the conditioner dried it out. Honestly used this and the shampoo for at least 2 or 3 months and saw no change in my hair.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I noticed a big difference with my hair after about 3 weeks of use.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I mixed this conditioner with olaplex and L'Oréal professional deep conditioner and I love the way my hair feels. My hair stylist even noticed my hair has been growing out. Definitely saw a change in hair growth more than I did with the biotin vitamins I was taking
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;This shampoo (and the matching conditioner) do make my hair feel soft, and the smell is great. But after 3 months of scalp acne I've decided that I need to change to something else. I've never had that problem before, and didn't even know that it could be a problem until now.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I have long fine color treated hair. After using the conditioner for a couple weeks I noticed my hair in my brush about 2x the regular amount and every time I ran my hand through my hair, I would have 5-10 strands in my hand multiple times. DO NOT BUY THIS if you want to keep your hair. I did like how my hair felt silky and felt light but it's totally not worth it haha.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Ever since Ive been using this product people have been asking me if I got hair extensions. It makes my hair look soo full. I use it with the marula oil conditioner - great combination as it keeps my ends hydrated. I also have a sensitive scalp in which most shampoos cause flaking but this shampoo doesnt irritate. So thankful to have bought this. Originally bought in store but will now be purchasing online religously :D
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Have bought this product before....it's great for body
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;After 6 weeks of use, my hair is not thicker and I still have no volume. My hair is smooth, but I was looking for some volume.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I love this product! Definitely my new go to conditioner. I have not tried the shampoo yet, but after this I'm definitely going to!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Honestly i love it! i had really dry scalp and this helped so much i tried many shampoos and conditioners and none seemed to work for me except this one! It made my hair super silky soft!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I bought the shampoo and conditioner and LOVE THEM! I have fine, thinning hair. This really plumps up my hair, smells great, and doesn't leave my hair greasy after a few hours. Smells yummy too!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Almost seems like a miracle. My hair is gorgeous after one use. Soft, bouncy and full of life.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;good
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I bought this product in February after reading some good reviews. I wanted to grow my hair out and add volume to it. Though this product did help me grow my hair, it broke me out SO BAD the minute I started using it and no matter what I tried, the breakouts were too big and aggressive. I've finally decided to stop using it because the outcome is not worth it. I would not recommend this to anyone, as there are many other products that can help you grow your hair that won't break you out severely!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;This shampoo does what it says and actually the first week I used it I got two compliments on how long and great my hair looked. However, it's  not worth the rash and scalp acne it caused. At first I thought I could manage a little hairline acne but now my scalp is completely irritated and my sideburns are full of acne. This has only happened to me once before (with Herbal Essences products) so I wouldn't say I have a sensitive scalp or anything, this is just really harsh I guess.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;This and the matching conditioner get the job done. I've been using them for 3 months. However, I personally didn't notice any dramatic changes. I don't really see any extra volume or a thicker/fuller effect on my hair, like the shampoo claims. Overall, it is a nice shampoo but I won't repurchase.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Eh wouldn't buy it again.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I love this product. My braiding stylist used it once after I ran out of my normal conditioner and I've been hooked. That was about a year ago. I love the smell and the price. My hair is thick and kinky. I am a 4a/b hair texture. Yes, it detangles too and I am very tender headed so I am a fan!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Daughter's hair has never looked this good or been this easy to take care of
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;This conditioner smells amazing. But that's about all the positive I have to say about this. It leaves residue in my hair and is causing some buildup. It's also super drying and causing my hair to be slightly unmanageable when trying to comb out afterwards. I will continue to use in small amounts along with a leave in conditioner that I now have to use to make my hair manageable but I will not repurchase.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;This shampoo smells amazing. It lathers well and feels good in the shower. However, it doesn't do much for adding volume or thickness to my hair. And I think it's a bit drying. The matching conditioner doesn't do much for the dryness either. Will probably use until it's gone but won't repurchase.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;This conditioner instantly gets out all tangles and knots in my curly hair no matter how many days old it is!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I purchased OGX because it came recommended by a hairstylist friend. I have somewhat oily, fine, wavy/straight hair. This shampoo/conditioner leaves my hair so dry and it feels like I didn't wash all of the product out every time. Not fan. Smells nice and the conditioned is nice and thick.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Great quality shampoo at a great price. Plus, it smells amazing!! My hair feels so clean after using this shampoo, yet it's gentle and doesn't dry my hair out. It actually feels stronger.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;gave this shampoo/conditioner a go but did not become a fan. It made my hair greasy by the second day, the smell was not pleasant and it made my hair fallout. i WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS SHAMPOO/CONDITIONER.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I have fine hair and volume/body is always a concern. I saw a noticeable difference within 2 uses! I love this shampoo!!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I gave this shampoo/conditioner combo a go, and I totally hate it! It leaves a thick, almost waxy feeling to my hair afterwards and it weighs it down so much. I thought maybe I was using too much product, so I used less, but even then it still left a very unpleasant feeling to my hair after my hair dries. Not to mention my hair looks like a grease ball by day 2! I won't be repurchasing.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I'm unsure if it's the shampoo, conditioner, or a combination of both, but this certain line of OGX leaves my hair with a waxy, weighed down feeling afterwards. I've tried using less product (thinking I was using too much) but even then it leaves a unpleasant feeling to my hair. Not a fan!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Every time I shampoo my hair
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I use this shampoo every other day with the matching conditioner and have told friends about it. I love the full thickness it gives my hair!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I love this shampoo (along with the matching conditioner). I noticed my hair was fuller after one use. Gives much better results than some expensive brands I've tried. Will buy again!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;We used this as our girls weekend out! And we all loved the smell and how it made our hair feel. We all have different types of hair.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;"This product is full of harmful sulfates that WILL dry your hair out. Depending on the individuals hair, they may notice right away (first use) or they may not notice until multiple or even several uses. But this WILL damage your hair. Having hair that ""APPEARS"" thicker is not worth the possibility of going bald. I mean the amount of reviewers with an experience of hair falling out is enough to make you not want to take the risk anyway. This shampoo did nothing for my hair back when I used it but make it extremely dry, brittle, itchy, tangled, etc. IF YOU WANT THICKER OR LONGER HAIR JUST TAKE ACTUAL BIOTIN VITAMINS. Try the rice water technique. Try using less heavy products. There are a ton of other ways that worked for me. This just wasn't one of them."
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;This shampoo dried my hair out so much and didn't give me any volume at all. My hair has always been really dry and thick so maybe it would work better on thinner or oily hair.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;My hair was thinning out a lot and I was starting to get worried. I've been super stressed and also breastfed my daughter for a year. Immediately after using my hair felt, clean fuller and thicker. I was shocked! I also purchased conditioner. And would recommend using both. I used just shampoo one time without conditioner and it felt fluffy. I'm so happy I found this!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I have purchase this product and was excited to try it considering the great reviews I read, after the first wash it left my hair feeling silky, soft and smelling good. I even noticed the boost in volume. Shortly after less then 2 weeks of using this product my hair began to fall out in HUGE clumps and it left my hair greasy and dry and at the ends.. I would not recommend anyone buying this if you have dry or straight hair..
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I wash my hair every other day and the volume it gives is great
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Left my scalp dry and flaky and my hair oily
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;This product (and even the brand) have been so hyped by people around me that I decided to try it this semester.  Upon reading some other comments here, I FINALLY figured out I'm not the only one struggling with this shampoo!  Before using this product, I had thick, wavy hair that I loved.  Sure I've changed lengths and cut my bangs 4 times here and there, but I've never dyed it and the texture has always been the same.  I've been using this shampoo consistently for 4 months waiting for my thick hair to come back.  I'm a nightshower-er, so I use this right before bed.  Twice a week, I've been conditioning with their coconut milk conditioner.  I've been waking up the morning after itching my head like I have a terrible case of lice (even though I have NO bugs in my head and don't see any dandruff), and I continue to feel the urge to itch it throughout the entire day.  My scalp has been ridiculously waxy and greasy all the time as well, and it's gotten to the point where dried shampoo can't even dry all that gunk out for a few hours while I'm in class or at work.  Plus, the whole bottom half of my locks are all dried up, so having my hair down closely resembles a wet rat.  I wear my hair up most of the time to cover it.  It feels so good to know I'm not alone, and I'll DEFINITELY be trying a new product ASAP.
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;This shampoo lathers so well! My hair feels and smells super clean! And most importantly, my hair looks thicker and more healthy. I actually got lots of compliments on my hair after using it!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;I have 3b thin hair and I bought this product excitedly hoping it would give my hair the fullness i've always wanted but instead my hair ended up falling out in clumps :( didn't give the product 1 star because it probably works better on straight hair despite saying it works on any hair type and it smells really really good
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Don't use this product daily because it will ruin your hair. It will cause it to thin out. I have naturally thick hair and I used this product and my hair was ruined after continual use. Just don't use this product at all— there is much better out there!
Biotin & Collagen Extra Volume Extra Strength Conditioner;Before I went natural I used to straighten my hair 24/7 every day and it broke off a chunk of hair unfortunately but this stuff fixed that and grew out my hair and made it more thicker!! I am now natural (3b curl type) and I still use this product and it still works just as good!!
Smoothing + Liquid Pearl Luminescent Serum 3.8oz;It's a serum and it feels like it's alcohol drying out your hair.
Smoothing + Liquid Pearl Luminescent Serum 3.8oz;Product does exactly what it claims to do. After I towel dry my hair I apply this and it's wonderful. When my hair dries is super soft and silky. This is a great product for hot, humid days. As far as the smell goes…it has a unique smell to it and I definitely smell an oceany fragrance, but it does mention sea kelp on the bottle so I'm not surprised.
Smoothing + Liquid Pearl Luminescent Serum 3.8oz;As much as I wanted to like this, unfortunately it left my hair feeling so dry. Had to go back to my Moroccanoil to get some moisture back in my hair. The glitter in the serum stayed mostly on my hands and probably contributed to the dry feeling in my hair.
Smoothing + Liquid Pearl Luminescent Serum 3.8oz;I've been using silicone free products the last year, and one thing I was addicted to using was OGX's coconut milk serum. I loved using that to deal with frizz after my hair was dry. Well, that's full of silicones.  so a couple days ago I came across this, and it's CGM approved and silicone free. I used this in the same way, on dry hair, to see if it would tame my hair to make it until my next wash. I think it did okay! The sparkles do nothing except get all over your hands, lol. But it made my hair feel soft and kept it under control and shiny until I could go wash it again. The smell is nice. Sort of like sea salt in a good way. I enjoy this product and I'll keep using it. Also, finding silicone free serums seems to be super tough, and when I find them they're always like $30, so this is a nice budget friendly option.
Smoothing + Liquid Pearl Luminescent Serum 3.8oz;This stuff is amazing period
Smoothing + Liquid Pearl Luminescent Serum 3.8oz;It's so good and made my hair rich. It made it silky soft with a great shine to it.
Smoothing + Liquid Pearl Luminescent Serum 3.8oz;Shine without the weight.
Smoothing + Liquid Pearl Luminescent Serum 3.8oz;I won't spend the money on this product again.
Smoothing + Liquid Pearl Luminescent Serum 3.8oz;This is a lightweight product that adds so much shine to my straight hair. A little goes a very long way!
Smoothing + Liquid Pearl Luminescent Serum 3.8oz;"This is a very light serum and too much can make hair ""wet"". It's not really for frizz control or flyaways but it smells amazing"
Smoothing + Liquid Pearl Luminescent Serum 3.8oz;HOLY GRAIL hair serum!  I have dry curly (3C) hair and this adds incredible shine and definition.  I had been looking for a serum to smooth my curls, and this is perfection.  I work it through towel dried hair, then apply my styling gel and style as normal.  This has definitely taken my hair styling routine to a new level.
Smoothing + Liquid Pearl Luminescent Serum 3.8oz;I love how this serum makes my hair soft.
Smoothing + Liquid Pearl Luminescent Serum 3.8oz;I wanted to love this product. It does help with fly-aways and frizz but i couldn't get past the strong perfume type smell. It was so bad I had to wash it out of my hair after about an hour.
Smoothing + Liquid Pearl Luminescent Serum 3.8oz;No difference.
Smoothing + Liquid Pearl Luminescent Serum 3.8oz;I got this liquid pearl luminescent serum in hopes that it would be a dupe for the aquage illuminating gelad, but it is nowhere near as impressive. The formula is thick in your hand when you squirt it out but as soon as you rub it between your hands to distribute it through your hair it becomes very thin. part of why I wanted this was to help with illumination and light reflection, but I see none of that. Even after multiple pumps and distribution, I couldn't find a way of using enough product to get the payoff that I wanted. and ultimately ended up with glitter all over my hands, which easily washed off, but I would like to make note that it left my hands very dry and that makes me nervous for what it would do to my hair. if you're looking for light reflection and illumination I would opt for the more expensive aquage option as I've had years and years of experience with that product. also, no I am not a brand rep for them or have anything to do with them, I just end up getting it when I was in high school and used to dye my hair red, and as I transitioned between different colors ultimately landing on blue hair, I found that it's the most all-inclusive product when it comes to light reflection.
Smoothing + Liquid Pearl Luminescent Serum 3.8oz;Smells so good and leaves hair shiny.
Smoothing + Liquid Pearl Luminescent Serum 3.8oz;I just bought the product because of the scent and it looks so pretty! The glitter just kind of sticks to your hands though. Great serum otherwise. I would not recommend for curly hair. (I have wavy)
Smoothing + Liquid Pearl Luminescent Serum 3.8oz;I have dark hair, and this product barely showed when I used it. It does smell really good, and look pretty, but I was disappointed.
Smoothing + Liquid Pearl Luminescent Serum 3.8oz;It smells good but it's watery and doesn't do much even the glitter doesn't show on my black hair. It doesn't give shine or nutrition or sleekness to my hair wont buy it again
Smoothing + Liquid Pearl Luminescent Serum 3.8oz;This smells AMAZING! I bought it because I couldn't get the smell out of my head after sniffing it in the store. The glitter is really pretty too and I figured it might leave an iridescent shimmer in my jet black hair. Unfortunately, this made my hair super greasy and the glitter stained my hands but NONE OF IT transferred onto my hair. Buy this if you're looking for a hair perfume, because that's really all it did for me
Smoothing + Liquid Pearl Luminescent Serum 3.8oz;Even the smallest drop of this stuff makes my hair so shiny and it smells amazing!!
Smoothing + Liquid Pearl Luminescent Serum 3.8oz;All I need is a dime size and my hair is long, but this leaves my hair so soft and sparkly. Or you can say a shine to it. I wasn't sure about this at first, but so glad I bought it. Yes, I will buy again and  recommend this to all my friends.
Smoothing + Liquid Pearl Luminescent Serum 3.8oz;"This product, in my opinion, has done nothing but smell amazing. When I get out of the shower I use a detangler and two pumps of this serum - just because it smells so good and makes me feel ""girly"" because of the glittery bottle. I haven't noticed it do anything other than that. If you look super closely to your hair you can see hints of glitter, but the glitter remains mostly on your hands. I don't think I'll be buying it again but it's okay!"
Smoothing + Liquid Pearl Luminescent Serum 3.8oz;It smells nice but it's kind of strong. It doesn't really do anything but make my hair smell nice. And I wouldn't recommend using it before blow drying or straightening. Because it's kind of drying. I'd only use it as a finishing touch.
Smoothing + Liquid Pearl Luminescent Serum 3.8oz;Was hoping more from this product. I really wanted to glitter to stay in hair but completely disappears while blow drying
Smoothing + Liquid Pearl Luminescent Serum 3.8oz;it works really well, exactly like it says it does, but there is loads of glitter in it. if i had realized there was glitter in it when i bought it, i would never had gotten this. as a glitter hater this product is my worst nightmare. it gets all over my hands, face and my pillowcase. not worth the hassle.
Smoothing + Liquid Pearl Luminescent Serum 3.8oz;This serum makes my hair shiny for plenty of days to come! I really love it and suggest it to anyone who wants their hair to get some extra shine for the day. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the smell. It has a very strong floral scent that sticks essentially until your hair dries. If you're not a fan of floral scents, this serum might not be for you.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Voluminous Mousse 8oz;To hold hair better
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Voluminous Mousse 8oz;To hold hair better
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Voluminous Mousse 8oz;I have baby-fine straight hair that is also thinning. Not a great combination! I have tried so many different mousses and sprays for adding volume and this mousse is by far the best one I've found. It makes my hair thicker and shinier, but there's nothing stiff or sticky about it. I absolutely love this mousse.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Voluminous Mousse 8oz;I follow the Curly Girl method, and this product is perfect for my curl pattern!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Voluminous Mousse 8oz;My daughter uses this product every day. She can't do her hair without it. I also use it from time to time, I love the hold, and the way it is not to heavy on my hair.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Voluminous Mousse 8oz;I was trying to find an alternative product to bring fullness to my fine lifeless hair. I previously used Redken Guts for years but honestly I hated how it made my hair feel, it gave it volume but I also couldn't run my fingers through my hair without it feeling like i have a bunch of product in it. The mousse is my new favorite product, it smells great, gives my hair volume and doesnt leave my hair feeling gross. Even the day after I style my hair it still looks great!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Voluminous Mousse 8oz;I use this to add volume to my short hair. It does this without making it especially crusty or crunchy like other mousses do. It smells good and feels luxuriously creamy and my hair feels soft after it dries.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Voluminous Mousse 8oz;I use this product after shampooing my hair. My hair is very fine and other mousse leaves my hair stick after use.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Voluminous Mousse 8oz;I use this product daily-keeps my hair frizz free without drying it out. Doesn't add an overwhelming amount of volume, but gives a little boost.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I have easily oily hair. I use it on the morning to tame bed head hair. my hair gets oily easy and my scalp aches with too much conditioner or product. This stuff does not weigh me down or cause oil or heaviness. I love it. Bought back up bottles. It detangles. Can't say enough good.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I love and recommend this stuff. I have oily hair. Can't use much conditioner because it weighs my hair down then my scalp hurts.  Same with much product. This stuff is awesome tho. I use this on my hair in the morning to comb out my bed head hair. Have no issues with weighing it down at all. Does not look greasy. Adds a bit of shine. Detangles as well. Highly recommend!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I struggled w frizz hair my whole life, this totally controlled the frizz, I've tried other Ogx hair serum like the coconut oil made my hair frizz sm, this one doesn't, I couldn't imagine my life without it. Gives my hair thickness, non frizz hair
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I was worried because the shampoos by ogx are not the best, and I recently stopped using them. I bought this and used as an after-shower hydration oil. It kept my hair shiny, soft and overall softened my dry ends. I only used a nickel sized amount in my wet hair and it lasted me like 3 or 4 months. I'm buying more again, but I think it depends on your hair type because other oils make my hair very greasy and stiff.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;This product makes your hair look shiny & soft, but after using it for a couple weeks I noticed my damaged hair got extremely dry & brittle. Wouldn't recommend.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I style my hair and apply just a few drops of this oil oil for some shine. It makes my hair feel so soft, shiny and of course it smells amazing. Also Gus product doesn't make your hair feel sticky like some other hair oils. I definitely recommend this product!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;This is a great mosturizer for dry hair. Applies easily with wet hair. Smell is sutle and nice.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;Heads up: this is not an oil! It's a serum. It's not going to moisturize your hair, but it's incredible for making it shiny, smell good, and frizz-less. If you want an oil that will actually moisturize your strands, OGX doesn't have that. Use 100% pure oils (from The Ordinary or SheaMoisture). I use this product along with Jamaican castor oil on my ends and love it. This doesn't make it look oily, so it's great to put on in the morning to help my ends and my little frizz on top of my head, and then comb the excess through my hair so it's smooth and shiny.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I tried this product on my hair for several months, and I feel like it did NOTHING for my hair. It made my hair dry, brittle, frizzy and caused dandruffs. I also couldn't stand the smell. I threw it in the trash where it belongs. If I could give this product zero stars I would. I don't recommend this product.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;i would not recommend ANY of the ogx products except for their shampoo+conditioner. this product contains bad silicones that could potentially make your hair fall out.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;"Gave it two stars because is smells ok but it didn't ""heal"" my hair. I don't get why this has so many good reviews? There are better oils out there"
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I love this spray because other oils are too heavy for fine, thin hair.  Great control, so hair is not too oily.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I have been using this for over a month and my hair looks healthier and feels less dry on my ends. And it's not too pricey for the good product that you get. You don't have to use much either and it smells great!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I've got long, curly hair and this works quite well for detangling or adding some shine to the ends. Smells good too!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I've been growing my hair out and the longer it gets, the dryer it becomes. This oil works wonders! I highly recommend!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;this thing WORKS! i always use this after i wash my hair and when i wake up the next morning my hair is so curly, so smooth, and shiny! but i would not recommend using this as a heat protectant or after you style your hair, just use a spray.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;Great product & affordable..
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I have thick wavy easily oily hair. I can't go very many days without washing but I prefer to. I can't use conditioner much because my scalp starts to hurt the next day when I do. Decided to try this and love it. Doesn't weigh my hair down. I use it after I blow it straight. Calms the frizz and adds a bit of shine.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I've already noticed changes only after a week using this product. My hair is shiner and looks and feels healthier. Get this!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I have been using this product for 3 years
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;This product is awesome. I originally bought it about a year ago to help tame my frizz when I curl my hair. It works pretty good for that. I do find that it weakens the curls though. What I found that this product works amazing for us healing split ends! I put this on the ends of my hair every night and brush through it. I've been doing that for about 2 months and my hair dresser said that she's never seen my hair so healthy!! Try this product it's amazing!!!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;Excellent!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I love this hair product.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;Got this because my hair was super dry after putting some blonde in it and it literally did everything I needed it to do. My hair is SO soft now. And also I would like to add I have very oily hair and most oils make my hair super greasy but this didn't do that. I don't spray it near my roots though.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I use this after styling to give my hair some protection and moisture.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I used this product after blowing out my hair, and then put my hair in a French braid. In the morning when I took the braid out my hair smelled like mildew, I completely dried my hair before I used it so I know it wasn't just from my hair still being wet.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;Love this product! I have very thick&frizzy hair and this helped tame away the frizz and made my hair feel very soft. I use it after I blow dry or straighten my hair. I also sometimes spray it on the ends of my hair when they need some extra moisture. It also smells amazing!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;This is amazing as a leave in conditioner, doesn't make my hair greasy at all. I've used this for years. Get it if you have dry hair or split ends.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I love how this smells!! It makes my hair smell like it just came from the salon. It's a good product if you shower in the morning because it keeps my hair soft all day but by the next day my hair is flat and dry.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I love how it smoothens my skin at the end of the day it really is smooth I love that feeling I just can't stand the smell of this thing, it's smells weird for me and also after atleast 18hrs of wearing it it leaves a heavy amount of grease in my hair that's why I had to immediately shower ew
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I used to use this a few years ago and I remember liking it, but when I tried using it now it was awful. It made my hair both dry and greasy somehow....like lots of frizz but weighed down with a greasy look. Maybe it's better if you blow dry your hair? Had to return.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;definitely made a huge difference to my hair. I use it after I shower and/or straighten my hair. it leaves my hair feeling so silky. a little bit goes a long way
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I sprayed around 7 pumps to only the ENDS of my hair because that is where my hair is most frizzy. Worked WONDERS!! I did use the olapex shampoo and conditioner while in the shower, but this product was really able to cut out the frizz and leave my hair shiny and soft. I've dyed it around three times in the past year, once with bleach, and this product knocked the frizz out.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I put it on my freshly shampooed hair for styling. Leaves my hair sleek and shiny.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;Product is best on market
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I love this stuff! My hair is thin and also damaged from getting highlights. It helps bring moisture back to my hair! The thing that I hate about it though, is I have VERY sensitive acne prone skin and this stuff makes me break out! Still trying to decide if it's worth continuing to use. :-/
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I have been looking for my holy grail leave-in product for my thin hair for so long and I finally found it! It is SO lightweight, doesn't weigh the hair down, and makes it super shiny and soft. My hair has never looked better and since it's oil-based it helps keep out tangles too. This is great for right out of the shower and also for touching up between washes. I always had to wash my hair every 2nd day because my ends were too dry, and this works amazing for helping to treat your ends so you don't have to wash and condition it. All around amazing multi-use product and I'll keep buying it again and again!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;My holy grail. I'll put this on when my hair is damp. After I brush, I'll separate my hair into two. A little goes a long way. It's very moisturizing and doesn't way my hair down. The best part about it is that it brings out my natural waves PERFECTLY. Almost looks like I have heat styled waves. It was always a struggle to bring out my natural waves without product as it would always frizz up. Not this product. Get it! You won't regret it!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I have thick coarse Hispanic hair, this stuff is a god send but you really only need a small amount. It instantly made my frizz vanish without leaving it greasy or sticking together. Super excited I took a risk with this and for the price it really is amazing.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;This oil makes my hair smell good and very soft
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;moisturizes my 3c curls so so well. it feels super duper nice and I love it!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;This is my must have product in my bathroom cabinet. My hair is always so dry no matter what products I use, but this oil has saved me so many times! It adds shine and tames frizz without making my hair oily. I spray on my ends and avoid my scalp. If you have any sort of dry or textured hair, this product is for you!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;this works a little better when my hair is straightened, but it makes my curls lose their definition and feel like straw
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;After reading so many glowing reviews and enjoying another oil by OGX (the biotin one) I decided to give this a try! A few uses in, and I'm disappointed and unimpressed.  The first time I used it, I used about a quarter about, like I would with the biotin oil.  Nope.  My hair ended up so greasy!  For the next few washes, I reduced my amount DRASTICALLY and blow dried my hair, still heavy, sticky, and greasy.  I have medium density hair (not too think, not too fine) so I'm shocked at how much this weighs my hair down.  It also doesn't have any scent, the other oil smelled AMAZING! Did I just get a defective bottle?
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I love the OGX Moroccan oil.  It makes my hair super soft and it smells amazing.  I have naturally fine hair that has some damage from frequent coloring, and a very small amount of this on gently toweled hair after a shower has done amazing things for it.  If you have fine hair I will say it's easy to accidentally use too much, you really need about the size of a pea for shoulder length hair, and if your hair also trends oils at the roots like mine, only apply it to the bottom half of your hair, focusing on the roots.  This also had the side effect of making my hands really soft.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;makes my hair smooth/shiny and really tames frizziness on my hair ! Very lightweight and smells great :)
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I put this on my hair immediately after I shower with other products and I love it.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;i personally love this product. i have very dry and damaged hair and this always leaves it silky and smooth. i put it on after the shower and before i do my hair i also put hair spray in there but this gives it more of a silky finish.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;Moisturizes my hair so well and it makes It so so soft. Very happy with this.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;Both my daughter and I have really frizzy, curly hair. This works great to manage our curls and helps to detangle it as well.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;this oil has been moisturizing and adding shine to my hair all day! I use it after blow drying and apply all over my hair, I love the smell and the frizz control I cant get over it. ogx infused with argan oil of morocco leaving my hair shiny and glowing, no more frizz ! healing dry oil. beeauty pure and simple. Must try.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I love this stuff so much. I think I've bought it like 4 times now! It smells fantastic, it makes my hair so soft and it is way easier to comb through when its wet, and also once it dries. I have pretty fine (and very damaged...whoops) hair that isn't very thick, and it doesn't weigh it down at all. I use about a dime size and rub it on my hands and work in, starting at the bottom. It's great, I can't say that enough.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;Love this product
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;So I never used to use oil because it normally wears my curls down. But this oil! I spray it multiple times day. Makes it shiny & keeps my scalp from being dry. love love love.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;Makes hair more manageable
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;My hair looks/feels soft and healthy.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I usually use this product after I shower it works great on my hair
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;Its great everytime i use it
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;Thank you!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I love this oil! It makes my hair so shiny and soft without being greasy or oily.  I just dyed my hair and everyone complimented how shiny it was.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I was amazed on how amazing my hair turned out! I absolutely loved! i added it to my hair before blow drying and after! my ends would always come out dry but this made it silky smooth!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;It did help with my bleaching my hair and I am sooo happy with it.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;Makes your hair soft and glossy.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;After I work out and shower.  I use it on my hair and it works perfectly.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I was worried this would be too heavy for my thin short hair but it wasn't :) I obviously use a very small portion but this stuff is awesome! Cuts down drying time and leaves my hair super soft and shiney :) I love this way more than the CHi oil.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I am growing out some old color, so the bottom third of my shoulder length hair is pretty parched. I've used the OGX Coconut Oil mist after I'm finished styling with pretty good results.  I decided to try this for a change, and I am so glad I did!  After reading some of the reviews here, I decided to try spraying this on my hair when it's wet to see how it would do.  I cannot believe how smooth it made my hair when I blew it dry!  I don't straighten my naturally wavy hair every day, but my hair just glided through my iron this morning.  I was so impressed, I felt compelled to write a review.  I still sprayed a bit in my hands and ran them through my hair when I was finished styling, like I did with the coconut oil, and it left my hair feeling silky and healthy all day.  I absolutely love this stuff!  Highly recommend.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I have really dry hair and this helped a lot with that, my hair looks less dull, it looks more healthy and it smells amazing!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;Spray into hand and run threw hair or spray a few times a few inches away from ended. Personally helped me with moisture after showers for a fix for my split ends.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;Love this. Smells sooooo good and leaves my hair feeling so soft when I wake up. I put this on after I've showered and brushed my hair.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;It smells amazing! The mist is so fine, it's light weight, not greasy and it gives beautiful shine. I love this!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I spray this on my hair every night before bed and then before I leave for work.  It has completely changed how my hair feels and looks.  I have pain-in-the-butt curly hair thats been through just about every treatment imaginable and dyed (because blondes have more fun right?).  This product has completely changed my life.  I do go through it extremely fast, but its relatively cheap so I don't care!!!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I like the product it smells good and is very light on my hair.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I've been using this for years now. Love it. Seems a little oily when you first put it on, but my hair absorbs it and it gives me softness and shine. I also like the smell.Works great., better than higher priced products.I'm always afraid they will discontinue it.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I asked a question on here about it being shiny enough. I bought it and whoa was it shiny! Love it! I use it almost everyday cause my hair is so thick. The only problem is it's only shiny in the sunshine and never indoors. Thinking about getting the shampoo and conditioner. Maybe that will help.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;Spritz on when using heat and it leaves hair smooth soft and shiny! What a bargain too! Smells great!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;Argan oil really does help maintain my hair. My hair is overprocessed therefore there's only so much it can do which is calm down frizz and coat my hair to keep it from looking like a broom. But I notice my hair turns yellow much quicker and after reading the ingredients listed in the bottle(which are not listed in this website) that it contains red and yellow dyes..
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I have natural curly hair. I don't wash my hair everyday but I wet it everyday. I've been having trouble finding something that can define my curls while keeping them baby soft. This product does that for me.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;It doesn't weight my hair down and pleasant smell.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I seen this once on Pinterest for dry brittle hair. So I purchased once & OMG now this like my 4 bottle or so. I use this once I step out the shower then blow dry or air dry May hair. Smells super good!! I spray once I straighten my hair too. I also use it the next day once I brush my hair. Hubby loves the smell too
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;Just spray it in your hair regularly and you should feel your hair feel softer and livelier. I just spray it on my ends.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;Affordable and actually softens texture of colored hair!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I always put it on my wet hair then blow dry. Just in case I put too much on the blow drying helps dry it out a little more. I also put it on my dry hair to try to smooth out the frizziness. You do need to be careful because you can put to much on and look like you have dirty oily hair.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;this products sucks. messed up my hair, drying it terribly. WORST product ever
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I have dry hair because I dye it.  I use this almost nightly.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;like it very much
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;Tamed frizz and smells amazing 🙌 doesn't leave a greasy residue
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;i use this product every day and it does a great job keeping my hair from getting frizzy. it works much better than other moroccan/argan oil products that i have used in the past. my only issue with it is that it's difficult to dispense the product without getting too much or dripping it all over the side of the bottle
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;Works great
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;Makes my hair feel good and healthy. I use it on damp hair and I love it. Good price too.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;Awesome! Lightweight oil! Superior!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;This is a very lightweight oil and it smells nice.  Not a heavy scent.  I spray a small amount in the palm of my hand and apply it to the ends of my hair.  Does a very nice job.  I ran out of my Moroccan Miricle Oil and was looking for something to use and this works great.  Would definetely recommend.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I love how weightless this product really is. I have thick wavy hair and any product can weigh it down even more. This adds shine, helps with the dryness, smells great, and gives shine without it looking greasy.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I've been spending tons of money on products for my daughter's curly, tangly, sometimes matted, frizzy, dry hair. It's been a nightmare, nothing works well at all. My friend and I were at Ulta and she recommended this. So, it wasn't a wash day for my daughter so I divided her hair into 3 sections, misted with water and sprayed this and then using a WIDE comb, I combed it through. WOW, incredible results. She then went to bed and I expcted to have to fight it again this morning but low and behold it was hardly tangled at all, just a bit at the ends. Another misting of water and this and it was perfect again.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;Makes my hair soft and smells really good!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;Man I was excited to try this only to find out it has drying ingredients such an trimthone an dimethicone smh
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I have wavy/curly hair and it took me years to find the right product for this humid Florida weather. Glad I chose to buy this product on a whim. It's not greasy on my hair and it smells good too! I usually spray it on my towel-dried hair after shower and my hair is ready in the morning.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I have crazy curly dry hair and this argan oil helps a lot.     I use it daily.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I bought this purely to add moisture to my hair on occasion. Not knowing if it would make my hair greasy, I decided to use it after my hair was towel dried and discovered that it made my hair dry so quickly! It's better than my Redken Pillow Proof Primer Spray and the Redken Diamond Oil Spray for a cheaper price. I can spray quite a bit onto my hair and it won't look greasy, so this product is a win.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I put it in my hair after almost every shower, my hair gets really tangly so this helps smooth it out and makes it feel a lot softer and smoother!!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;One of my all time favorite hair products!!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I use this on my hair twice a week
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I love using this product every day.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;leaves hair shiny and healthy looking! weightless. not greasy.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I love it. For my curls. They shine and stay moisturized throughout the day. Not looking dry
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I used to always think that hair products needed an expensive price tag in order to actually be good, but that's definitely not the case with this product. I have thick, frizzy, and chemically processed hair, and I use this oil every time I wash my hair. I apply it when my hair is still wet and whether I decided to let my hair air dry or I blow dry it, this oil has done so much to keep my hair looking and feeling good!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;"I was having a problem with ""static electricity"" and could not get it controlled.  this product did the trick.  Love it.  My husband also uses it every morning, he is balding and his ""scalp""is dry.  This product works!"
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I am disappointed in this product. I thought it would be a lot more effective and helpful to my damaged and dry hair. It isn't really doing much for me except leaving my hair looking and feeling greasy. The smell is great but i would not recommend this product for trying to restore your hair and get it healthy again. I just don't see it working.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I love this hair oil! I use it on wet hair before I blow dry it and it works better than Living Proof. I also spray a little on my finished hairstyle and it makes my hair soft and smooth. It repaired the damage I had from using Big Sexy Flat Iron Spray. This is amazing and I will continue to buy it again and again!!!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;i use this oil 1-2x a week, it helps keep my hair soft & smooth. i particularly like to use this after using a clarifying shampoo
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;Made my hair shiny but not oily, tamed frizz, smoothed dead ends and smells great! Buying again as I'm almost out of my bottle :)
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;This is hands down the best product I've used on my hair in a very long time.  It makes your hair feel so soft, look soft and not frizzy at all.  I flat iron my hair every day and it makes it look awesome!!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I just wash and go, this oil made my hair less frizzy
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;the best!!!!!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;Are use it after I wash my hair while it's still wet
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;Perfect if you have coarse horse hair like mine. It softens and makes hair more manageable
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;I have a pixie cut I used to bleach platinum myself (my hair is actually in really good condition), but the very back is ruined from the bleaching without help. Currently growing out my pixie for the second time and this helps make me frizzy straw like ends lay flat and feel smooth. Been using for three months now, def recommend. Only wish it fixed my hair rather than covered it.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil;Essential to smooth and detangle damaged frizzy blonde hair. I use about a tablespoonful on wet hair before I brush and blowdry.
Kandee Pop Glam Ultra-Hydrating Conditioner;Sure, it makes your hair smell amazing...until it all breaks and falls out.  I based my purchase off of the reviews instead of the ingredients list and I'm wondering if the positive reviewers got paid to say what they did.  My purple hair wasn't really damaged in the first place, I bought this line of products to experiment.  Huge mistake.  It contains alcohol in several forms and made my hair feel dry and brittle, and it knotted like crazy before breaking and frizzing after combing.  Used it twice and am returning...I'll never look back!
Kandee Pop Glam Ultra-Hydrating Conditioner;I love it
Kandee Pop Glam Ultra-Hydrating Conditioner;I love the smell but wish it was stronger.
Kandee Pop Glam Ultra-Hydrating Conditioner;I had extremely high hopes it smells amazing it has an awesome consistency but after one use my hair felt tangly and extremely dry.
Kandee Pop Glam Ultra-Hydrating Conditioner;I like OGX, but the Hugs and Kisses line leaves my hair very dry. I tried it because I have color treated hair, but I didn't like it at all. I like my hair to be silky soft, easy to comb through. This left my hair dry and unmanageable. Even applying conditioning spray didn't help it.  I had to use quite a bit of oil shine product afterwards. I don't recommend. I prefer the Keratin line.
Kandee Pop Glam Ultra-Hydrating Conditioner;I cannot get over how good the smell of the shampoo and conditioner is. The conditioner leaves my hair silk soft and I'm obsessed.
Kandee Pop Glam Ultra-Hydrating Conditioner;I've started using this as my day to day conditioner. The labeling caught my eye at the store but the SCENT was so AMAZING I had to buy it immediately! It's hard to find a sulfate free conditioner that has such a yummy smell. I happened to have a date that night and he commented on the scent pretty immediately. As a conditioner, it performs well. I am on day two hair (I have oily scalp and colored/processed hair). Hair feels soft and still scented. Well priced and a good amount of product.
Kandee Pop Glam Ultra-Hydrating Conditioner;"I bought this product several times because it's so good. The smell is beyond incredible and, despite the fact that it IS somewhat ""runny"", it conditions my hair well. I get that everyone has different hair types though. I have extremely dry, long and fine bleached hair. This doesn't weigh it down either. I'm in love"
Kandee Pop Glam Ultra-Hydrating Conditioner;This does absolutely nothing for my hair I think it's dried it out even worse! Only plus is the smell and for the price it should do what it implies, OGX is usually my go to but not this one, waste of money I'm returning it!
Kandee Pop Glam Ultra-Hydrating Conditioner;I bought the shampoo and conditioner, both smell AMAZING. I will definitely be repurchasing and recommend to all my friends!
Kandee Pop Glam Ultra-Hydrating Conditioner;I don't normally write reviews but this conditioner is absolutely horrible. It dried my hair out and made it feel like straw. I bought the shampoo and conditioner because they smelled so good (to me the scent is comparable to bath and body works one thousand wishes) and the shampoo is ok but I absolutely do not recommend the conditioner. It's a very thin formula and it look almost half the bottle just to feel like I actually put some in my hair and I don't have overly thick hair.
Kandee Pop Glam Ultra-Hydrating Conditioner;I wanted to love this so badly. it smells so good. but it doesnt soften my hair and the shampoo version doesnt cleanse. and my hair fallout has increased greatly in just the week Ive been using it. I'll go back to using hask peach & rose oil.
Kandee Pop Glam Ultra-Hydrating Conditioner;I waited a long time for Ulta to carry this product and I am not disappointed. I usually use the coconut milk, but also liked the Gum Drop and Sugar Cookie from Kandee a few Christmases ago. This however has become my all time favorite! My hair is so soft and the scent is delicious. It's a sweet smell and I just love it. I'm planning on stocking up on this one.
Kandee Pop Glam Ultra-Hydrating Conditioner;I loved the smell more than anything. The shampoo was awesome. Not too stripping and not too heavy, but the conditioner was very thin and runny. My thick hair loves thick conditioner!
Kandee Pop Glam Ultra-Hydrating Conditioner;This made me get scalp acne. Too thick and difficult to wash out.
Kandee Pop Glam Ultra-Hydrating Conditioner;Ok so I have had issues in the past with OGX shampoos and conditioners completely drying my hair out. Where I live, all of our tap water is filtered through limestone and is very very hard water. I struggle with it drying my hair out and am constantly trying to find ways for my hair to stay looking and feeling hydrated without being oily (I have very fine hair). I did not have a single issue with this product or any of the other ones in the line. Not the shampoo, the conditioner, or the hydrating mask the time I used that in place of the Kisses conditioner. My hair is super soft and looks silky without looking oily. Honestly phenomenal. Plus!! This stuff smells like Be Enchanted by B&BW. Loooove that.
KANDEE SHAMPOO;I bought this initially because I liked the smell in the bottle. After one use, my hair felt greasy, and not clean at all. The smell of the shampoo and conditioner smell different on your hair than in the bottle. Smells like chemicals and didn't do anything for me. I can't wait to wash my hair later to get this stuff out! Pretty disappointed and will be returning it.
KANDEE SHAMPOO;I have never hated results from a shampoo (and conditioner) more. I've used it twice and now my hair is dry and frizzy and completely unmanageable. I have fine, straight hair and this made a mess of it. Will be returning ASAP.
KANDEE SHAMPOO;I like the smell, but wish it was more powerful. I also wish it made my hair softer.
KANDEE SHAMPOO;I bought this product because I need a little hydration and it smelled really good. But after using it, my scalp feels irritated and more dry than before.
KANDEE SHAMPOO;It's good smelling and hair was soft and manageable
KANDEE SHAMPOO;I've started using this as my day to day shampoo. The labeling caught my eye at the store but the SCENT, oh my God was so AMAZING I had to buy it immediately! It's hard to find a sulfate free shampoo that has such a yummy smell. I happened to have a date that night and he commented on the scent pretty immediately. As a shampoo, it performs well. My hair feels hydrated and it cleans/rinses off well (I have oily scalp and colored hair). No complaints! Well priced and a good sized bottle of product.
KANDEE SHAMPOO;This has not only intensified my hair color but my hair is so soft and smells amazing!!! 💯 would recommend!
KANDEE SHAMPOO;I got this based off the smell alone. I shouldn't have. My hair is so brittle now, I havent dyed it in years and it feels like I just left bleach in for an hour. More fall out than normal too. And the smell is not good once it dries.
KANDEE SHAMPOO;one of the worst shampoo and conditioners I have ever tried. and it made mine and my mom's hair dry not moisturizing at all.and my hair is already dry. the only good thing about it is it smells very good but that is all
KANDEE SHAMPOO;i loved this shampoo at the first few washes than after that it started to really dry out my hair and the conditioner dried my hair out even more to the point where my hair spray and hair products couldn't save my hair's dryness from overdoing my hair with taking the red out of my head. im so disappointed because kandee has colored hair and i excepted way more out of this.
KANDEE SHAMPOO;I'm not sure why there are negative reviews on this product, although I realize that people have different hair types. I have extremely long, fine, bleached hair and I love this shampoo and conditioner! Not only does it smell absolutely incredible, after using it for over a month, my hair seems to be in great shape. I have not noticed any tangles or drying. I'm in love.
KANDEE SHAMPOO;This is the worst shampoo i've ever used!!!! It smells amazing, and I really wanted to love it because I love Kandee Johnson and usually I really like OGX products. This shampoo tangled my hair so badly! More than Ive ever experienced. Tangles arent something I usually have an issue with, but once I started using this shampoo, they became awful and painful!!!
KANDEE SHAMPOO;For the price and brand I expected better, it smells amazing but it did nothing for my hair I think it even dried it out more, I am definitely returning this for the one in the blue bottle because it does better.
KANDEE SHAMPOO;This product is absolutely amazing! it smells great and it lasts long in my hair. I works very well, so i am very glad! I'd recommend this to anyone that can't seem to find that right shampoo or conditioner.
KANDEE SHAMPOO;I got the shampoo and conditioner, both smell AMAZING. Would definitely repurchase and recommend!
KANDEE SHAMPOO;It does not dry your hair . It comes out soft & shiny.
KANDEE SHAMPOO;This is my new shampoo and conditioner! I spent $60.00 on high end shampoo and conditioner and it came nothing close to this stuff!! I will never switch!
KANDEE SHAMPOO;I love it! It smells amazing and leaves my hair soft.
KANDEE SHAMPOO;This has an amazing smell that lasts for days, but my downside and disappointment was it stripped my color little by little. It didn't give me any vibrant nor help prolong my color. Even when I went weeks in between shampoos. It still stripped. Highly disappointed.
KANDEE SHAMPOO;This shampoo and conditioner worked wonders on my hair, didn't way it down and it smells nice.
KANDEE SHAMPOO;Ok so I have had issues in the past with OGX shampoos and conditioners completely drying my hair out. Where I live, all of our tap water is filtered through limestone and is very very hard water. I struggle with it drying my hair out and am constantly trying to find ways for my hair to stay looking and feeling hydrated without being oily (I have very fine hair).

Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Strength Conditioner;I have natural red hair long. This did not to hydrate my or help my locks.
Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Strength Conditioner;This is like any drug store conditioner. It didn't do wonders for my hair or anything. I did like the smell
Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Strength Conditioner;The bottle sucks. It's too hard to squeeze, the product is thick which is great for thick hair but you can't get it out of the bottle. I would only buy again if the bottle is better. And you should be able to store the bottle upside down.
Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Strength Conditioner;This conditioner made my hair lose its shine and made my hair overall frizzy it's not good
Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Strength Conditioner;I just bought this and used it once and right after washing I already have dandruff. I used the shampoo and conditioner of this product and day 2 hair is worse. Im going to return because I really dont like this product. It may work for other people, but for me it just leaves me extra dry... I have white flakes all up in my hair...which is so disgusting to me!!!
Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Strength Conditioner;I have FINALLY found my holy grail shampoo and conditioner!!! Unfortunately deva curl made my curly hair extremely dry and brittle and this made a significant improvement just after one wash. I love the smell and how it moisturizes my hair. I don't think I'll ever buy a different shampoo and conditioner EVER
Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Strength Conditioner;I just purchased the other day and finally used this morning. I like the smell and it made my curly hair less frizzy and more defined. I was using higher end brands, but I can't spend the money on that at the moment. It didn't detangle completely, but I like that it's sulfate and paraben free which is great for curls! I am going to continue to use, I love it so far.
Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Strength Conditioner;Great Conditioner
Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Strength Conditioner;"I bought this shampoo since it claimed to be ""hydrating"" but it leaves my hair extremely dry."
Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Strength Conditioner;Hydrates nicely and makes my thick curly hair soft and smooth.
Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Strength Conditioner;This totally detangled my hair and made it feel smooth
Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Strength Shampoo;Had to change my shampoo because this one was causing my hair to be extra oily and made me produce a lot of dandruff.
Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Strength Shampoo;"Please do not use this shampoo or any product from the OGX brand! There is an ingredient in all recently sold products called ""DMDM hydantoin"" that has caused lawsuits for hair loss and hair breakage! You can even see it in the ingredients list in the description. I used to love this shampoo until I recently found this out. Please for the sake of your hair, don't use this! Check the ingredients in every product you use."
Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Strength Shampoo;My son has a scalp condition, this shampoo has made such a difference in that we do not have to use medications on his scalp now.
Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Strength Shampoo;First wash, a big fan. I let my hair air dry, & it's so soft, shiny, & seems to have come back to life after just one wash. It smells great, was silky, & lathered very well. Will update my review if anything changes
Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Strength Shampoo;never buying OGX products again. bought this after reading claims about being sulphate free. still made my hair fall out like never before. hair feels dry and brittle. need to use a lot for cleaning my hair. i would never recommend this product.
Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Strength Shampoo;I have FINALLY found my holy grail shampoo and conditioner!!! Unfortunately deva curl made my curly hair extremely dry and brittle and this made a significant improvement just after one wash. I love the smell and how it moisturizes my hair. I don't think I'll ever buy a different shampoo and conditioner EVER
Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Strength Shampoo;Great nourishing shampoo with a wonderful smell!
Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Strength Shampoo;Wonderful
Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Strength Shampoo;I use this about twice a week & my hair is so soft & shiny! Since I've started using it I've gotten compliments on how pretty my hair looks. Definitely going to buy It again
Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Strength Shampoo;I will keep purchasing.
Pracaxi Oil Deeply Restoring Recovery Conditioner;I have 3A/3B hair, and this product wreaked havoc on it. The shampoo cleanses fairly well, but the conditioner quickly absorbs into the hair and has little to no slip. It took wasteful handfuls of this conditioner to go through my hair, and I could hear strands snapping the whole time no matter how gentle I was. When I rinsed my hair, my hair felt dry and rough. When I went to style my hair, my curls were loose and lifeless. After trying the product again, I got the same results, dry and brittle hair.
Pracaxi Oil Deeply Restoring Recovery Conditioner;This smells wonderful and makes my hair very soft. I am finding myself washing my hair less frequently when I use the shampoo/conditioner combination because it still smells and looks nice. However, this doesn't help with frizz at all for me which is why I took one star off.
Pracaxi Oil Deeply Restoring Recovery Conditioner;I'm a firm believer that curly hair needs that extra moisture and slip and this conditioner DOES THAT! It's affordable, hydrating, and helps with curls and frizz.
Pracaxi Oil Deeply Restoring Recovery Conditioner;I always use ogx products but it is hit or miss when trying new ones. I have very long, thick, wavy/curly hair and I was amazed by how springy my curls were after using this. I honestly don't think any product has ever made my hair feel this healthy and I LOVE the smell!
Charcoal Detox Dry Shampoo;I have a ton of very fine hair so I'm prone to greasy, oily looking hair after one day. I can go at least 3 days between washes with OGX. This doesn't leave my hair looking white & dusty. It brushes through easily to evenly distribute the dry shampoo. Refreshes my locks and smells great.
Charcoal Detox Dry Shampoo;It added noticeable volume.
Charcoal Detox Dry Shampoo;Gave this one a shot, and so glad I did!. This stuff is incredible and the smell is Intoxicating. This stuff smells so good, not overpowering and doesn't linger to long. My hair looks so fresh and it immediately soaks up any oil making your hair fresh and looking fuller. Will definitely be purchasing again.
Charcoal Detox Dry Shampoo;This product works just fine, but the smell is so overpowering that I am nauseous for hours 😩
Pracaxi Oil Deeply Restoring Recovery Shampoo;I buy the OGX shampoos all the time because they're convenient, a good price, and usually all work well. This one is definitely my least favorite out of all of the ones I've tried. My hair has been extra tangly lately and I've been using this shampoo for the last couple of months. I usually brush my hair before I wash it, shampoo, put in a conditioner/mask, and then use a wide tooth comb in the shower to spread out my conditioner. Usually that part is easy since my hair is already brushed and the conditioner softens it, but after using this shampoo I'm taking 5-10 minutes trying to get a bunch of knots out. Even after drying and styling I can't run my fingers through my hair as easily. My scalp also doesn't feel clean enough. I will continue to buy other OGX shampoos but not this one.
Pracaxi Oil Deeply Restoring Recovery Shampoo;I am constantly worried about buying moisturizing products that are not meant for European hair. After reading several reviews, I decided to give this a try and buy the whole pracaxi line. To my surprise, it is just enough for my hair to make it manageable & soft. My husband ran his fingers through my hair after my first use and commented how silky my hair was. It's so affordable, too!
Pracaxi Oil Deeply Restoring Recovery Shampoo;This shampoo/ conditioner (I bought the set) completely dried out my hair. When I used the shampoo my hair had that rubbery/ residue feel. I've used Ogx before and my hair has never felt this dry before. The conditioner did not help my comb out at all ! Idk if it's me or the product but this did not work for my hair.
Pracaxi Oil Deeply Restoring Recovery Shampoo;Sulfate free, restoring, and doesn't make your hair feel dry when you massage it in! I have sensitive scalp and so far no itching or irritation. Affordable and smells good!!
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;When I first used it, it made my hair soft. I've been using it for a few months maybe close to a year now and I've seen a lot of hair loss and my hair feels dried out and more tangled. Then I read about the lawsuit OGX is in right now and decided to stop using it went to Ulta and got another more organic shampoo.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;Please research class action lawsuit before buying OGX shampoo and conditioner!!!
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;My dry hair is soft and smelling good love it
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;My hair is so soft and it still smells clean and no extra grease
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;Great shampoo made my dry hair feel soft without weighing it down. Nice clean fragrance.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;My boyfriend has a very bad scalp psoriasis. Every shampoo and conditioner he is ever used has made it way worse. We finally got him started on this shampoo and conditioner and now he hardly has any flareups. I would definitely recommend it also smells wonderful
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;This product makes my hair silky and moisturized and it feels stronger. For a year or so I used whatever shampoo, I didn't really care but I noticed my hair got really dry and didn't grow as fast. I also noticed a lot of hair fall, so I decided to switch to this brand because it is sulfate free. I started with the golden turmeric shampoo and it helped a little but still didn't give me the results I wanted so I switched to the argon oil one and I've seen a big improvement already. I am going to stick to this shampoo because it makes my hair feel very healthy and strong. I also like the conditioner as well.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;This was my holy grail conditioner for about five years, but the new reformulation is just terrible. It smells worse, is thinner, I have to use much more than I used to and it barely seems to do anything for my hair. My hair is wavy/curly/frizzy and thick so I really need a conditioner that does the work, and this just doesn't anymore.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;it smelled amazing and it lathered very well. however, my scalp started to burn right after i put it in my hair. idk if it will happen to anyone else but it did to me.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;This is my all time favorite shampoo. Made my dry hair moisturized and soft. But I hate how there's DMDM hydantoin😩
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;This was great for my hair!! After just one use, my hair was soft shiny, and was no longer greasy! 10/10 would recommend
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;This was great for my hair!! After just one use, my hair was soft shiny, and was no longer greasy! 10/10 would recommend
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;"Don't use this!!! It has DMDM hydantoin which when mixed with water (you know, like when you're washing your freaking hair) becomes FORMALDEHYDE. It is a toxic chemical and a known CARCINOGEN. Which if you don't know, means it can cause CANCER. It also can cause your hair to fall out and begin balding. If you don't believe me please Google! This is as far from ""orangix""/organic as you can get."
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;Can't believe I finally found something to tame my wavy frizz, and it's a drugstore brand. This stuff is gold.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;This product worked wonders for my hair . I bought the small one just to try it out and I like it better then my regular shampoo and conditioner (dove)
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;Add texture or fragrance in between shampoo's
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;"I used to love this stuff years ago. The smell was so good but different from regular ""fresh"" smelling things, like a darker but sweeter scent. I bought this and remembered how the conditioner worked great on my long straight hair. They must have changed the formula bc now it was like I didnt use any conditioner on my hair at all. And i use a lot everytime because my hair is so long. Even when rinsing it out it didnt feel as silky as any other conditioner like it did the opposite and dried it out. Same when it is wet and out of the shower combing it out was like I didnt use any conditioner at all and in knots and tangles. Also when I dried it just seemed like it didnt condition at all. I've never had this problem with any other conditioners or shampoos. But I forgot and repurchased it thinking it was going to be how I remembered it and same thing dry dry dry. The conditioner did nothing for my hair except dry it out. I wish it worked like it used to bc it smells so different and good."
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;my hair felt just as dry as it was before. it really did nothing
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;I dont like how this smells at all. The spray worked okay but I have used better dry shampoos for cheaper/same price.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;This is the worst product I've ever used. After hearing about it for like forever I decided to give it a try.. It made my hair sooooo dryyyyy like wooow I can not believe that there are people out there that love this product. It's the worst.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;this product gives my skin an allergic reaction but i still use it bc it's THAT good
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;i've almost used the whole bottle and at this point have to buy a clarifying shampoo to get rid of all the buildup this product leaves. i've used it with the conditioner and it leaves my hair greasy. i usually don't have that problem with other shampoos. definitely won't repurchase and don't recommend
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;I was progressing so well with my hair and the length and thickness was amazing. I wanted something to give it a bit more shine and life so I tried this out and it did nothing but strip my hair of everything and make it super frizzy/damaged again. Don't buy it.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;Love this shampoo and conditioner. I use it on my coarse wavy hair and it helps reduce frizz and smooth it out.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;I tried this a couple of times before I threw it away because each time it made my hair sticky and didn't absorb the oil from my hair. It was almost like using hairspray, not dry shampoo. It smells amazing which is why I wanted to try it but I'll stick with Batiste from now on.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;I have gave this products two chances but it's not a good product. The price is good but Leaves hair dry and frizzy.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;This shampoo and conditioner duo smells really good, the bottles are fun colors and it sounds like it's good for the environment. However, it's disgusting beyond that. It makes my hair so sticky at the roots (which after doing some reading, sounds as if it is because it is sulfate free.) Also, the shampoo is very thick. I write this review after spending nearly a hour trying to clean the residue from it out of my shower. I needed chemicals that are probably not good for the environment to clean it, making it a loose loose situation environmentally.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;I really Enjoy the OGX Brands . They do not cause my scalp to flare up or dry out my hair . Going on a Trip , I found this travel size & was over the moon .
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;I give this a 5 just from the smell of the shampoo and the way my hair feels after using it. It really makes my hair feel nice and leaves my curly and frizzy hair with a more maintainable feel afterwards. also leaves my hair smelling so amazing that I will use time and time again
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;Love
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;best conditioner ever for my wavy hair. smells like heaven< 3
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;Great conditioner.  Smells great and makes my hair smell great.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;I really like this shampoo.  It smells good and makes my hair soft.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;I've been using the Dry Bar dry shampoo for years now, and consider it holy grail as it does what it's supposed to do as a dry shampoo which is cancel out the greasiness of the hair and make it look fresh. This product didn't make my hair less greasy and did not absorb the oil. It does smell good though.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;My hair looked much healthier, shinier, and bouncier after a few washes with the shampoo and matching conditioner. It also smells really good and retains the smell for a few days.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;When I bought this conditioner, I had no idea what to expect. I bought it a few weeks ago with the intentions of fixing my damaged, dry hair before I dyed it again! When I got this in the mail, I was NOT disappointed! The scent of the conditioner itself can be compared to cocoa butter in terms of smell, though not as much of a strong sweet aroma. I used the conditioner in the shower, and after the first wash, there was a SUPER distinguishable difference in the texture of my hair! It made my hair soft to the touch. By far the most fast-working conditioner I've ever used, and I plan on getting a full-sized bottle very soon!
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;I bought the minis for my trip to Los Angeles and fell in love with this shampoo(and the conditioner.) Smells so good to me and left my hair silky. I always let my hair air dry as I don't use heat on my hair and there was no frizz. I have medium/fine wavy hair for reference.  Highly recommend!
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;I've used some of the other OGX shampoo/conditioners that made my hair feel great, but this shampoo specifically was terrible. I got a huge bottle of the Argan oil shampoo/conditioner on sale and noticed that even though I had just gotten a haircut my hair became dry with split ends very quickly. I'm using up the conditioner with other shampoo brands. Namely head and shoulders because this also made my scalp dry or caused buildup. However, it seems there's no saving the shampoo. Might just be my hair type which is straight and fine.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;Gave me BAD dandruff and drys out my hair! Would never use again
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;My hair was dry from the shampoo, but the conditioner restored my hair. If using the shampo o, you MUST use the conditioner as well.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;It works as a shampoo. Great smell. Left my hair a bit dry though, but not too much to where I wouldn't use again, I will purchase more.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;The shampoo and conditioner if this is amazing for daily use. Also, I love the pleasant smell. Smells clean and simple. Its perfect for my color treated hair.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;I am not sure how this product is on the market. As soon as I started using it, I developed scalp pain. I wasn't sure if it was the shampoo so I continued using and realized I was losing my hair in large amounts. As soon as I switched shampoos the pain subsided and I noticed my hair was not falling off as much. I am not sure what ingredients this shampoo and conditioner have that could have caused so much damage in the 1 week that i used it.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;I love you this shampoo.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;Love it. Simple. Inexpensive
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;Was wondering if you changed the formula? I've been using ogx argan oil shampoo amd this time around it it different and really thick and doesn't smell good. Normally its awesome. I wonder if I just got an old batch?
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;I've been using this conditioner for years. The shampoo id also recommend but I use the conditioner way more. It's honestly a great product. I've spent $$$ on conditioner products before and this one is well below that price range. It easily comparable if not better than the higher priced ones anyway. If you can find the larger sized bottle, grab it. Otherwise the smaller one is most common in stores. It's great for daily use, or every couple days. I use it as a leave in conditioner, although most often people opt against using a regular conditioner as a leave-in. It's safe for your hair and I've had no issues. I will continue to buy this product over and over again.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;SMELLS GREAT AND WORKS WONDERFUL
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;I bought the travel size as I'm trying to test other dry shampoos out to see if I should switch brands, but nope I continue goin back to my batiste as I have not found anything better! This smells great and sprays on easily and evenly, however it's does absolutely nothing. My hair still feels oily and dirty. Wouldn't buy again.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;hair conditioner
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;Only used once have not formed a opinion yet.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;The shampoo worked pretty well for me but I am not a fan of the conditioner. It did not make my hair feel soft and it was very hard to brush my hair after showering. The hair felt dry and more frizzier than ever. I do not use heat on my hair anymore and before using this product I never had an issue with tangled hair after the shower. I feel like the conditioner just doesn't work and once air dried, my hair felt not very clean. I couldn't run my fingers through my hair without hitting a knot. I'm disappointed because I felt this would help with my wavy, frizzy hair but if anything it has dried my hair and made my hair hard to brush causing me to loose hair due to tangled hair.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;I was hoping to find another dry shampoo to love but this was not it, especially disappointed because other products from this brand are great. It doesn't have the smooth and powdery feel of some others, it just feels and smells like putting cheap hairspray in your hair. I hated the way it made my hair feel and it wasn't very voluminous or oil absorbent either. Made my hair tangle easily. I would only use this to add texture to my hair for styling an updo, but not as a dry shampoo.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;My hair was getting dry. This shampoo makes it softer, it's still clean and it smells great!
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;This conditioner doesn't make your hair look bad. The negative thing about it is that the argan oil made me break out all over my face and hairline. At first I didn't know what was wrong because I totally forgot that I had added this to my routine. Then I realized after over a month of getting acne on my cheeks which I have never before in my entire life... that it was this conditioner. I had changed nothing else in my routine except this. It's been 4 days since I stopped using it and my face has already stopped to clear up. I think this would be a nice product if I hadn't broken out all over my face. The results with the hair were not worth it.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;Love this brand. This works very nice on my hair would  defiantly  buy it again
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;I love the shampoo and it save my oily hair daily. My hair usually got oily after 8 hours even using regular shampoo for oily hair. However, the shampoo is a magic and it makes my hair stays clean for 18 hours. Also, never have itchy scalp after using OGX.  The shampoo doesn't dry my hair out, and it makes most parts of my hair hydrate.  It only dries the end of my hair, so I would recommend to use conditioner for the end of the hair. The shampoo smells great and I have purchased more than one bottle.
Renewing + Argan Oil Of Morocco Shampoo;Wssh my hair 4 days a week.
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;Worked well to prevent my hair from getting dirty but once my hair was already a little greasy it felt like this did nothing.
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;i have very oily hair and i can never go two days without washing it, so i purchased this dry shampoo to help me out. when applied, it didn't leave too much white residue, however, it added oiliness to my scalp and flattened my hair. i learned my lesson after 3 more attempts with it that this dry shampoo with added oils doesn't mix well with my already oily scalp haha. that said, it would probably do wonders for people who have drier or normal hair.
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;Alright product. Gets the job done. Does take quiet a bit sometime.
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;I love this! Smells amazing and makes my hair smooth and shiny!
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;I've tried half a dozen brands of dry shampoo ranging from $4 to 30, and the OGX works really well with no residue and a nice scent. I see no reason to switch away from this one, at least for my hair (which without dry shampoo looks greasy after just one day of no wash).
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;This is a great dry shampoo. Smells nice. Great price. Large bottle so it will last me awhile. Adds volume to my hair. Makes my 2 to 3 day hair look fresh.
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;Great scent- effective at absorbing oils and making hair feel fresh.
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;Dry shampoos make my head itch like crazy and my hair still looks gross after using. I use this weekly 1-2x and I keeps my hair fresh. it also smells good!
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;Nice shine and nice smell, unfortunately I had to use to much product for my thin oily hair.  Did not leave me with enough volume.  May be better for someone whose hair is not super oily or those not looking for volume.
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;Switched from Dove to this after noticing hair loss and thin patches (will never use Dove again). This product smells amazing, lasts for over 24 hours, and does not leave a white residue like most. Will be recommending to all of my girlfriends! Truly is nourishing and has softened my hair. I no longer feel excessive dryness. This product saved my hair.
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;This product works well, but can't get past the smell, I thought it might smell like coconut, but instead it's like body odor
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;Love how this absorbs oil and doesn't make my fine hair look gross. and it smells so good!
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;Good buy! Would definitely purchase again. It does leave a white residue on hair as most dry shampoos do. However, this one you can brush out/blend it into the root easily.
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;Favorite dry shampoo, only thing that seems to work on my super oily hair without breaking the bank!
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;As a working mom, this product is a life saver for my hair.
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;I love the way it smells and the texture it provides your hair without the build up!
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;I received this one, Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo along with the Argan oil of Morocco  one on the same order & somehow Coconut oil was already emptied. I am baffled by this!!
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;I have curly/wavy hair and this is my favorite dry shampoo. I live by Not Your Mothers toasted coconut texturizing dry shampoo, but this is my new favorite. It actually refreshes your hair without messing up your curls or leaving a white film. SMELLS AMAZING like coconut and vanilla
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;Smells and feels amazing... best dry shampoo hands down and super affordable.
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;Smells amazing and just feels amazing after applying to your hair. Even my boyfriend uses it now 🤣😅
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;So, I am usually someone who feels like I need to wash my hair everyday.  I feel like if I don't my hair feels oily, dirty and not clean.  I've tried many dry shampoos before that the smell was overbearing, giving me a headache later in the day.  When I use this dry shampoo, it smells great, light coconut smell that smells clean and isn't strong at all.  Which is good because who wants headaches from a dry shampoo?  Highly recommend this, so I can now to maximin 2 days without feeling the need to wash my hair.  And for me, that's huge...and saves me a ton of time!!
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;love love love..... This is my first time using dry shampoo. I see mixed reviews for this one, but I really like it. The scent is absolutely amazing! It gave me a nice lift and literally made my locks look like I had just washed and styled. I didn't experience any white stuff as previously mentioned, but I have medium to light colored hair. Will def buy again!
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;This is my first time using dry shampoo. I see mixed reviews for this one, but I really like it. The scent is absolutely amazing! It gave me a nice lift and literally made me locks look like I had just washed and styled. Will def buy again
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;The SMELL. Omg. 😍 I live for it. But also, the way it works is AMAZING. I've been using the coconut not your mothers for about 2 years and decided to switch things up. I tried so many different ones just because, until I finally landed on this one. No white cast, no strange feel in your hair, wonderful scent and super flexible and texturizing! Love!!
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;I tried spraying far from the hair and still it turned my hair white also doesn't do its job. would never buy again
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;Smells great & works, but it's one of the tougher ones to rub in/never quite disappears
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;I have thin hair that I color copper. This does not leave that weird white cast in my hair. Sucks up all the oil, and smells great. I have oily skin and scalp and get greasy the next day after washing. This stuff helps me go 3-4 days without washing. I love it so much more than even the expensive brands.
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;I have very fine, thin hair and not a ton of it. Usually dry shampoos make my hair even greasier making them pointless. This is the only dry shampoo that worked for my hair type (including high end brands). If you have thin hair that gets greasy, I definitely recommend trying this one! I've also tried other dry shampoos from this brand, but this one was the only one that really worked for me.
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;I bought this to try because I've never really used dry shampoo. This was the perfect price and size to give it a go. The spray smells amazing and got rid of that oily look on my no wash hair days.
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;Leaves white specks behind after spray & brush out
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;The smell is great and probably the only dry shampoo I'll ever use to be honest.
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;Great dry shampoo ! Does not leave white residue
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;I use this dry shampoo in between my hair washing days. I also have a travel size for my gym bag for a quick refresh. The scent is my favorite. I separate the top of my hair and spray sections. This absorbs oil quickly. You only need a little or it could make your hair stiff and the scent might be overwhelming.
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;I have chin length dirty blond, fine, thick hair and wanted to use this to refresh the previous days blow out. This just coated my hair and didn't give any lift whatsoever. My roots were still oily and my hair was gray matte. A waste.
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;I use this at least 3-4 days a week. It's amazing!!!!!
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;I kept this bottle for a while as a back-up for batiste. I've used it probably 10 times and I hate it every single time. It does not work at all. I haven't had a problem with my hair being noticeably oily in over a year, but when i spray this to try to add volume or fix some oiliness, it makes it a million times worse. i don't feel very strongly about too many hair products, but this is the worst.
Travel Size Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo;Best dry shampoo ever !! Works so well on oily hair and flattened out my roots. Very easy to work with! Have purchased 2 bottles:)
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;When I first used it, it made my hair soft. I've been using it for a few months maybe close to a year now and I've seen a lot of hair loss and my hair feels dried out and more tangled. Then I read about the lawsuit OGX is in right now and decided to stop using it went to Ulta and got another more organic shampoo.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;Please research class action lawsuit before buying OGX shampoo and conditioner!!!
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;My dry hair is soft and smelling good love it
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;My hair is so soft and it still smells clean and no extra grease
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;Great shampoo made my dry hair feel soft without weighing it down. Nice clean fragrance.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;My boyfriend has a very bad scalp psoriasis. Every shampoo and conditioner he is ever used has made it way worse. We finally got him started on this shampoo and conditioner and now he hardly has any flareups. I would definitely recommend it also smells wonderful
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;This product makes my hair silky and moisturized and it feels stronger. For a year or so I used whatever shampoo, I didn't really care but I noticed my hair got really dry and didn't grow as fast. I also noticed a lot of hair fall, so I decided to switch to this brand because it is sulfate free. I started with the golden turmeric shampoo and it helped a little but still didn't give me the results I wanted so I switched to the argon oil one and I've seen a big improvement already. I am going to stick to this shampoo because it makes my hair feel very healthy and strong. I also like the conditioner as well.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;This was my holy grail conditioner for about five years, but the new reformulation is just terrible. It smells worse, is thinner, I have to use much more than I used to and it barely seems to do anything for my hair. My hair is wavy/curly/frizzy and thick so I really need a conditioner that does the work, and this just doesn't anymore.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;it smelled amazing and it lathered very well. however, my scalp started to burn right after i put it in my hair. idk if it will happen to anyone else but it did to me.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;This is my all time favorite shampoo. Made my dry hair moisturized and soft. But I hate how there's DMDM hydantoin😩
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;This was great for my hair!! After just one use, my hair was soft shiny, and was no longer greasy! 10/10 would recommend
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;This was great for my hair!! After just one use, my hair was soft shiny, and was no longer greasy! 10/10 would recommend
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;"Don't use this!!! It has DMDM hydantoin which when mixed with water (you know, like when you're washing your freaking hair) becomes FORMALDEHYDE. It is a toxic chemical and a known CARCINOGEN. Which if you don't know, means it can cause CANCER. It also can cause your hair to fall out and begin balding. If you don't believe me please Google! This is as far from ""orangix""/organic as you can get."
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;Can't believe I finally found something to tame my wavy frizz, and it's a drugstore brand. This stuff is gold.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;This product worked wonders for my hair . I bought the small one just to try it out and I like it better then my regular shampoo and conditioner (dove)
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;Add texture or fragrance in between shampoo's
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;"I used to love this stuff years ago. The smell was so good but different from regular ""fresh"" smelling things, like a darker but sweeter scent. I bought this and remembered how the conditioner worked great on my long straight hair. They must have changed the formula bc now it was like I didnt use any conditioner on my hair at all. And i use a lot everytime because my hair is so long. Even when rinsing it out it didnt feel as silky as any other conditioner like it did the opposite and dried it out. Same when it is wet and out of the shower combing it out was like I didnt use any conditioner at all and in knots and tangles. Also when I dried it just seemed like it didnt condition at all. I've never had this problem with any other conditioners or shampoos. But I forgot and repurchased it thinking it was going to be how I remembered it and same thing dry dry dry. The conditioner did nothing for my hair except dry it out. I wish it worked like it used to bc it smells so different and good."
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;my hair felt just as dry as it was before. it really did nothing
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;I dont like how this smells at all. The spray worked okay but I have used better dry shampoos for cheaper/same price.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;This is the worst product I've ever used. After hearing about it for like forever I decided to give it a try.. It made my hair sooooo dryyyyy like wooow I can not believe that there are people out there that love this product. It's the worst.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;this product gives my skin an allergic reaction but i still use it bc it's THAT good
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;i've almost used the whole bottle and at this point have to buy a clarifying shampoo to get rid of all the buildup this product leaves. i've used it with the conditioner and it leaves my hair greasy. i usually don't have that problem with other shampoos. definitely won't repurchase and don't recommend
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;I was progressing so well with my hair and the length and thickness was amazing. I wanted something to give it a bit more shine and life so I tried this out and it did nothing but strip my hair of everything and make it super frizzy/damaged again. Don't buy it.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;Love this shampoo and conditioner. I use it on my coarse wavy hair and it helps reduce frizz and smooth it out.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;I tried this a couple of times before I threw it away because each time it made my hair sticky and didn't absorb the oil from my hair. It was almost like using hairspray, not dry shampoo. It smells amazing which is why I wanted to try it but I'll stick with Batiste from now on.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;I have gave this products two chances but it's not a good product. The price is good but Leaves hair dry and frizzy.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;This shampoo and conditioner duo smells really good, the bottles are fun colors and it sounds like it's good for the environment. However, it's disgusting beyond that. It makes my hair so sticky at the roots (which after doing some reading, sounds as if it is because it is sulfate free.) Also, the shampoo is very thick. I write this review after spending nearly a hour trying to clean the residue from it out of my shower. I needed chemicals that are probably not good for the environment to clean it, making it a loose loose situation environmentally.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;I really Enjoy the OGX Brands . They do not cause my scalp to flare up or dry out my hair . Going on a Trip , I found this travel size & was over the moon .
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;I give this a 5 just from the smell of the shampoo and the way my hair feels after using it. It really makes my hair feel nice and leaves my curly and frizzy hair with a more maintainable feel afterwards. also leaves my hair smelling so amazing that I will use time and time again
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;Love
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;best conditioner ever for my wavy hair. smells like heaven< 3
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;Great conditioner.  Smells great and makes my hair smell great.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;I really like this shampoo.  It smells good and makes my hair soft.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;I've been using the Dry Bar dry shampoo for years now, and consider it holy grail as it does what it's supposed to do as a dry shampoo which is cancel out the greasiness of the hair and make it look fresh. This product didn't make my hair less greasy and did not absorb the oil. It does smell good though.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;My hair looked much healthier, shinier, and bouncier after a few washes with the shampoo and matching conditioner. It also smells really good and retains the smell for a few days.
Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Hydrating Conditioner;When I bought this conditioner, I had no idea what to expect. I bought it a few weeks ago with the intentions of fixing my damaged, dry hair before I dyed it again! When I got this in the mail, I was NOT disappointed!
