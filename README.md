# OpenSearch
This project contains the OpenSearch configuration using Docker Compose, along with documentation to help you get started quickly.

## **What is OpenSearch?**  
OpenSearch is an open-source search and analytics suite designed to provide a scalable and high-performance solution for managing and querying large volumes of data. It is a fork of Elasticsearch and Kibana, developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and maintained by the community.

### **Key Features:** 
- üîç **Full-text Search**: Ability to perform advanced search queries on large volumes of data.
- üìà **Scalability**: OpenSearch is designed to scale horizontally, enabling the management of huge amounts of data.
- üìä **Aggregations**: Allows performing advanced data analysis through aggregations and statistics.
- üìâ **Interactive Dashboards**: OpenSearch Dashboards provide a web-based visualization and analysis interface.

## **Project Overview and Objectives** 
This project aims to explore and evaluate OpenSearch, focusing on its core functionalities and integrations. The key goals include:
- üîç **Observability Analysis**: Understanding how OpenSearch handles observability and its relation to OpenTelemetry.
- üìä **Feature Exploration**: Examining OpenSearch‚Äôs capabilities, including search, analytics, and visualization.
- ü§ñ **AI/ML Support**: Investigating the AI/ML functionalities provided by OpenSearch, such as anomaly detection.
- üéØ **Hands-on Deployment**: Setting up OpenSearch locally using Docker Compose to experiment with its features.

## **How to Set Up OpenSearch Locally with Docker Compose** 
To run OpenSearch on your local environment, you can use Docker and Docker Compose. Below are the steps to configure and start OpenSearch using the `docker-compose.yml` file provided in this repository.

### **Prerequisites**  
Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:  
1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) üê≥ - Required for containerized OpenSearch deployment.
   
   - Verify installation:
     
     ```bash
       docker --version
       ```
2. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) üõ†Ô∏è - For managing multi-container applications.

   - Verify installation:
     
     ```bash
       docker-compose --version
       ```

### **Setup Instructions** 

1. **Clone or Download this Repository** üìÇ:
   Download or copy the `docker-compose.yml` file from this repository to your local system. Place it in a directory where you'd like to run OpenSearch.

2. **Customize Configuration** ‚öôÔ∏è:
   Ensure that the `docker-compose.yml` file is properly configured for your environment. You can customize settings like network ports or memory if necessary.

   **Note**:  
   Fresh installs of OpenSearch 2.12 or later require you to define an admin password for `opensearch-node1` and `opensearch-node2` when configuring the security demo. You must set the `OPENSEARCH_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable for these services.

   Example configuration in `docker-compose.yml`:

   ```yaml
   services:
     opensearch-node1:
       environment:
         - OPENSEARCH_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_password_here

     opensearch-node2:
       environment:
         - OPENSEARCH_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_password_here
   ```
   Ensure that the password is the same across both nodes and meets OpenSearch's password requirements. For detailed guidance on setting up the password and the requirements, consult the [official guide on demo configuration](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/security/configuration/demo-configuration/).
   
4. **Start OpenSearch** üöÄ:
Once you've downloaded the necessary files, navigate to the folder containing `docker-compose.yml` and run the following command to start OpenSearch:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```
    This will download the necessary Docker images and start the OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards containers (the web interface for managing OpenSearch).

5. **Access OpenSearch Dashboards** üåê:
Once the containers are up and running, you can access OpenSearch Dashboards via your browser at [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601) and log in with the default username `admin` and the password you set in the `docker-compose.yml` file (e.g., `<your-password>`).

6. **Stop the containers** ‚èπÔ∏è:
When you're done, you can stop the containers with the following command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

    Alternatively, you can stop the containers by pressing `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where you ran `docker-compose up`. This will stop the containers, but     they will remain in a stopped state. To remove them entirely, you should run `docker-compose down`.

## **Troubleshooting** üõ†Ô∏è
If you encounter issues, here are some common solutions:
1. **Ports Already in Use**
   
   If port `9200` (OpenSearch) or `5601` (Dashboards) is occupied, modify `docker-compose.yml`:
   ```yaml
     ports:
       - "9201:9200" # Change the external port
       - "5602:5601"
    ```
   Then restart OpenSearch with:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down && docker-compose up
    ```
2. **Authentication Errors**

   - Ensure that the admin password is set correctly in `docker-compose.yml`.
   - Restart OpenSearch to apply changes.

3. **Container Not Starting**

   Check logs for errors:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs opensearch-node1
    ```
   If necessary, remove existing volumes and restart:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down -v && docker-compose up
    ```
