# OpenSearch
This project contains the OpenSearch configuration using Docker Compose, along with detailed documentation to help you set up and explore OpenSearch efficiently.

## **What is OpenSearch?**  
OpenSearch is an **open-source search and analytics suite** designed to provide scalable, high-performance data management. It enables businesses to **index, search, and analyze** vast amounts of data with features such as full-text search, aggregations and interactive dashboards. 

It is a fork of Elasticsearch and Kibana, originally developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and maintained by the OpenSearch community.

### **Key Features:** 
- üîç **Advanced Search Capabilities**: Perform complex full-text searches on large datasets.
- üìà **Scalability**: OpenSearch is designed to scale horizontally, enabling the management of huge amounts of data.
- üìä **Aggregations & Analytics**: Execute statistical queries and derive insights from structured and unstructured data.
- üìâ **Interactive Dashboards**: OpenSearch Dashboards provide a web-based interface for data visualization and monitoring.
- ü§ñ **AI/ML Integrations**: Supports AI-driven features like anomaly detection and predictive analytics.

## **Project Overview and Objectives** 
This project aims to explore and evaluate OpenSearch with a focus on its core functionalities, integrations and use cases. The objectives include:
- üîç **Observability Analysis**: Study how OpenSearch integrates with observability tools and its compatibility with OpenTelemetry.
- üìä **Feature Exploration**: Investigate OpenSearch's capabilities in search, analytics, and visualization.
- ü§ñ **AI/ML Support**: Evaluate OpenSearch's AI/ML features, such as anomaly detection.
- üéØ **Hands-on Deployment**: Set up OpenSearch locally using Docker Compose for hands-on experimentation.
  
## **How to Set Up OpenSearch Locally with Docker Compose** 
To start using OpenSearch, it is recommended to deploy it in a local or cloud-based environment. One of the most efficient ways to install OpenSearch is via **Docker Compose**, which simplifies deployment by managing OpenSearch and its dependencies in isolated containers.

Follow these steps to setup OpenSearch using Docker Compose:

### **Prerequisites**  
Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:  
1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) üê≥ - Containerization platform required for deployment.
   
   - To verify installation, run:
     
     ```bash
       docker --version
       ```
2. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) üõ†Ô∏è - Tool for managing multi-container applications.

   - To verify installation, run:
     
     ```bash
       docker-compose --version
       ```

### **Setup Instructions** 

1. **Clone or Download this Repository** üìÇ:  
   Download or clone the repository containing the `docker-compose.yml` file to your local system. You can choose the directory where you'd like to run OpenSearch.

2. **Understand the Configuration** üí°:  

   The `docker-compose.yml` file typically defines a minimal OpenSearch cluster with two nodes: 
     - `opensearch-node1`: Handles indexing and search operations.  
     - `opensearch-node2`: Works alongside node1 to provide redundancy and scalability.  
   
   This setup ensures: 
   - **Fault tolerance**: If one node fails, the other continues operations.
   - **Scalability**: Workloads are distributed across multiple nodes, improving performance.
   - **Advanced search capabilities**: Supports full-text search, log analysis, and machine learning-based anomaly detection.

3. **Customize Configuration** ‚öôÔ∏è:  
   Open the `docker-compose.yml` file and configure it according to your environment. For example, you can change port mappings or memory settings based on your system's resources.

   > ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note:**  
   > For OpenSearch 2.12 or later, you must define an admin password for both `opensearch-node1` and `opensearch-node2` when configuring the security demo. Set the `OPENSEARCH_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable in `docker-compose.yml`:
   > 
   > **Example configuration:**
   > 
   > ```yaml
   > services:
   >   opensearch-node1:
   >     environment:
   >       - OPENSEARCH_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_password_here
   > 
   >   opensearch-node2:
   >     environment:
   >       - OPENSEARCH_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_password_here
   > ```
   >
   > Ensure that the password is the same across both nodes and meets OpenSearch's password requirements. For detailed guidance on setting up the password and the requirements, consult the [official guide on demo configuration](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/security/configuration/demo-configuration/).
   
   
4. **Start OpenSearch** ‚ñ∂Ô∏è:  
Once the configuration is complete, navigate to the directory containing `docker-compose.yml` and run the following command to start the cluster in detached mode:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    This will download the necessary Docker images and launch OpenSearch along with OpenSearch Dashboards.
   
    By default: 
      - OpenSearch is accessible at http://localhost:9200
      - OpenSearch Dashboards is accessible at http://localhost:5601

5. **Verify OpenSearch is Running** ‚úÖ:  
   To check if OpenSearch is active, visit http://localhost:9200 in a browser or run:
   ```bash
    curl -X GET "http://localhost:9200" 
    ```
   A successful response should return JSON output similar to:
   ```json
    {
    "name": "opensearch-node1",
    "cluster_name": "opensearch-cluster",
    "cluster_uuid": "8qHNNTCSRlWke8As-EOl8w",
    "version": {
        "distribution": "opensearch",
        "number": "2.18.0",
        "build_type": "tar",
        "build_hash": "99a9a81da366173b0c2b963b26ea92e15ef34547",
        "build_date": "2024-10-31T19:08:04.231254959Z",
        "build_snapshot": false,
        "lucene_version": "9.12.0",
        "minimum_wire_compatibility_version": "7.10.0",
        "minimum_index_compatibility_version": "7.0.0"
    },
    "tagline": "The OpenSearch Project: https://opensearch.org/"
   }
    ```
   Additionally, to confirm the containers are running properly, check your Docker container list. You should see both OpenSearch nodes (opensearch-node1 and opensearch-node2) as well as the OpenSearch Dashboards container, confirming that the entire OpenSearch cluster is operational. 

6. **Exploring OpenSearch Dashboard** üåê:   
   After successfully launching OpenSearch, you can access the OpenSearch Dashboard, a graphical interface that allows you to interact with indexed data, create visualizations, and monitor system performance.

   To open OpenSearch Dashboard, navigate to http://localhost:5601 and log in with the default username `admin` and the password you set in the `docker-compose.yml` file (e.g., `<your-password>`).

7. **Stopping the OpenSearch Cluster** ‚èπÔ∏è:  
When you're done, you can stop the containers with the following command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```
   
   This command will shut down and remove all containers, networks, and volumes associated with the OpenSearch deployment.

    Alternatively, you can stop the containers by pressing `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where you ran `docker-compose up`. This will stop the containers, but they will remain in a stopped state. To remove them entirely, you should run `docker-compose down`.

## **Troubleshooting** üõ†Ô∏è
If you encounter issues, here are some common solutions:
1. **Ports Already in Use**
   
   If port `9200` (OpenSearch) or `5601` (Dashboards) is occupied, modify `docker-compose.yml`:
   ```yaml
     ports:
       - "9201:9200" # Change the external port
       - "5602:5601"
    ```
   After making changes, restart OpenSearch with:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down && docker-compose up
    ```
2. **Authentication Errors**

   - Ensure that the admin password is set correctly in `docker-compose.yml`.
   - Restart OpenSearch to apply the password change.

3. **Container Not Starting**

   If OpenSearch doesn't start correctly, check the logs for error messages:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs opensearch-node1
    ```
   If the issue persists, remove existing volumes and restart:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down -v && docker-compose up
    ```
